        "clinical_case": "The authors would like to thank Arshya Vahabzadeh, M.D., for his contributions to an earlier edition of this case. \n\nRobyn Thom, M.D. \nEugene Beresin, M.D. \nChristopher McDougle, M.D. \n\n**Brandon** was a **12-year-old boy** brought in by his mother for **psychiatric evaluation** for **temper tantrums** that seemed to be contributing to **declining school performance**. The mother became **emotional** as she reported that things had always been **difficult** but had become **worse** after Brandon entered **middle school**. Shortly after starting middle school, Brandon had started complaining of **stomachaches** on school-day mornings and was often **reluctant to go to school**. \n\nBrandon's sixth-grade teachers reported that he was **academically capable** but that he had **little ability to make friends**. He seemed to **mistrust** the intentions of classmates who tried to be nice to him but attempted to befriend others who laughingly feigned interest in the toy cars and trucks that he brought to school. The teachers noted that he often **cried** and rarely **spoke** in class. In recent months, multiple teachers had heard him **screaming** at other boys, generally in the hallway but sometimes in the middle of class. The teachers had not identified a cause but generally had not disciplined Brandon because they assumed he was responding to provocation. He was **embarrassed** about these outbursts and did not want to go to swim practice because he did not want his swim friends to ask why he'd had an outburst at school. \n\nWhen interviewed alone, Brandon responded with **nonspontaneous mumbles** when asked questions about school, classmates, and his family. When the examiner asked if he was interested in toy cars, however, Brandon **lit up**. He pulled several cars, trucks, and airplanes from his backpack and, while not making good eye contact, did talk at length about vehicles, using their apparently accurate names (e.g., front-end loader, B-52, Jaguar). When asked again about school, Brandon pulled out his cell phone and showed a string of text messages: 'dumbo!!!!' 'mr stutter'; 'LoSeR'; 'freak!'; 'EVERYBODYHATES YOU.' While the examiner read the long string of texts that Brandon had saved but apparently not previously revealed, Brandon added that other boys would whisper 'bad words' to him in class and then scream in his ears in the hall. 'And I hate loud noises.' He also told the examiner that he sometimes wished that he had never been born. \n\nDevelopmentally, Brandon spoke his first word at age 11 months and began to use short sentences by age 3. He had always been very focused on trucks, cars, and trains. According to his mother, he had always been 'very shy' and had never had a best friend. As he has gotten older, it has become more apparent that he **struggles with jokes** and typical young adolescent banter because 'he takes things so literally.' Brandon's mother had long seen this behavior as 'a little odd' but added that it was not much different from that of Brandon's father, a successful attorney, who had similarly focused interests. Both of them were 'sticklers for routine' who 'lacked a sense of humor.' Brandon's mother noted that he made efforts to **conceal his interest** in trucks, cars, and trains outside of the home but would eagerly speak about them when encouraged. Brandon has shared with his mother that he tries to appear 'normal' when interacting with peers at school, which is **exhausting**. He often feels **nervous** around peers and generally tries to **avoid socializing**. \n\nOn examination, Brandon was **shy** and generally **nonspontaneous**. He made **below-average eye contact**. His speech was **coherent** and **goal directed**. At times, Brandon **stumbled over his words**, **paused excessively**, and sometimes rapidly **repeated words** or parts of words. Brandon said he felt okay but added that he was **scared** of school, particularly when around other children. He appeared **sad**, brightening only when discussing his toy cars. He **denied** current suicidal thoughts or plans as well as homicidality. He **denied** psychotic symptoms. He was **cognitively intact**.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Brandon's symptoms align more with  Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  He exhibits social communication difficulties, restricted interests (focused on vehicles), and repetitive behaviors (repetitive use of words or parts of words).  His reluctance to interact with peers and preference for solitary activities also point towards ASD. "

        "clinical_case": "**Stewart Adelson, M.D.**\n**Rosemary Tannock, Ph.D.**\n\nCarlos was a **19-year-old Hispanic college student** in his **freshman year** at a **public university** in a **large city**. He was **referred** by his **guidance counselor** to the **hospital's outpatient psychiatric clinic** for help with **academic difficulties**. Since **starting college 6 months earlier**, he had done **poorly on tests** and been **unable to manage his study schedule**. His **worries** that he was going to **flunk out of college** were leading to **anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration**, and a **general sense of hopelessness**. After a **particularly tough week**, he told his family that he thought he should **quit**. His **mother accompanied him** to the clinic that had **previously helped** both Carlos and his younger brother. The mother specifically wondered whether Carlos's '**ADHD**' might be causing his problems, or whether he had **outgrown** it.  \n\nCarlos had been **seen at the same clinic** when he was **age 9**, at which time he had been **diagnosed** with **attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominantly combined type**. Notes from that **clinical evaluation** indicated that Carlos had been in **trouble at school** for **not following instructions, not completing homework, getting out of his seat, losing things, not waiting his turn**, and **not listening**. He had **trouble concentrating** except in regard to **video games**, which he 'could play for hours.' Carlos had apparently been **slow to talk**, but his **birth and developmental histories** were otherwise **normal**. He **repeated first grade** because of **behavioral immaturity** and **difficulty learning to read**. The ease with which Carlos learned **English, his second language**, was not noted. His **family** had **emigrated to the United States** from the **Dominican Republic** when he was **5 years old**. The family was **Catholic** and attended **church every Sunday**. Both of his **parents** worked in **maintenance and housekeeping** at a **local municipal hospital**.  \n\nDuring the **evaluation** when Carlos was age 9, a **psychoeducational assessment** by a **clinical psychologist confirmed reading problems** (particularly problems in **reading fluency and comprehension**). Carlos did not, however, meet the **school board criteria** for a **learning disability**, which required evidence of a **20-point discrepancy** between **IQ and achievement scores**. Thus, he was not **eligible for special education services**. The **evaluator** had noted Carlos to be **eager to do well** and **anxious about underperforming**. His **anxiety** was thought to be a **reaction** to his **school difficulties** and his **challenges** in meeting the **academic expectations** of his family. Carlos's **pediatrician** had recommended **pharmacotherapy**, but his **parents** did not want to pursue **medication**. They cited **negative experiences** with local youth who used **diverted controlled substances** and hung out 'on the street.' Instead, his **mother** reported taking on an **extra job** to pay for **tutors** to help her son 'with **concentration and reading**.' The **eldest of four siblings**, Carlos had done **well** with this **intervention** and was now the **first member of his family to attend college**.  \n\nThe **psychiatry trainee** carefully reviewed Carlos's **academic history**; his **symptoms**, including the **course and severity** of **sadness, anxiety, insomnia**, and **hopelessness**; and his **social and developmental history**. She obtained **collateral history** from his **family** and **school records**. She used the **revised DSM-5-TR Core Cultural Formulation Interview** for assistance in obtaining a better understanding of Carlos's **acculturation experiences**, the family's past **feelings** about the **clinic's recommendations**, and what **treatment interventions** would be relevant and acceptable to Carlos and his family.  \n\nThe **psychiatry trainee** learned that Carlos had a **childhood history** of '**nervousness**' identified by a neighborhood **curandera (traditional healer)** as **ataque de nervios**. The family had addressed this problem with **supportive prayer** and a **traditional herbal tea**. They had apparently not revealed this to the **psychiatrist** at the time, thinking he would find it **irrelevant** and not wishing to seem disrespectful of his authority. During these **unrevealed episodes** of **acute anxiety**, Carlos would experience **trembling and agitation, palpitations, shortness of breath, dread of harm**, and **fear of separation** from caregivers. **Workup** by the **pediatrician** had revealed **no physiological cause**.  \n\nSince **starting college**, Carlos reported that he had frequently been **unable to remain focused** while **reading** and **listening to lectures**. He was **easily sidetracked** and therefore had **difficulty handing in his written assignments on time**. He complained of feeling **restless, agitated**, and **worried**. He described **difficulty falling asleep, poor energy**, and an inability to '**have fun**' like his peers. He reported that the **depressive symptoms** went 'up and down' over the course of the week and possibly influenced his **problems with concentration**; it was hard for him to be certain. He **denied substance use**.  \n\nCarlos said that he'd had some **great teachers in high school** who had **understood him, helped him get the meaning of what he read**, and allowed him to **audiotape lectures** and use **other formats** (e.g., videos, wikis, visual presentations) for **final assignments**. Without this **support at college**, he said he felt '**lonely, stupid, a failure - unable to cope**.' Although **advised** by his **high school teacher** to do so, Carlos had not **registered** with the **university's student disability services office**. He **preferred** not to be seen as **different** from his peers and thought he should be able to get through **college** by himself.  \n\nCarlos's **family history** was **positive for ADHD** in a younger brother. A cousin was reported to have had '**dyslexia**' and had **dropped out** of a local community college after one semester. His **social and developmental history** revealed that he had been **well liked** by his cluster of friends throughout school. His group consisted of **boys and girls** and tended to consist of kids more interested in **school** than in sports. Carlos **denied** ever having **dated** or been **sexually active**, and he also denied having any **significant interest** in pursuing either of these activities.  \n\nOn **examination**, Carlos was **well-groomed, polite**, and **soft-spoken**. He wore clean jeans, a T-shirt, and a hoodie that he kept pulling down over his face. He sat **quietly** and **hunched over**. He **sighed** a lot and **rarely made eye contact** with the clinician. He often **tapped his fingers** and **shuffled** in his seat but responded **appropriately** to questions. His **command of English** appeared **strong**, but he spoke with a slight **Spanish accent**. He often **mumbled** and **mispronounced** some multisyllabic words (e.g., he said '**literalchure**' instead of '**literature**' and '**intimate**' when he clearly meant '**intimidate**'). He **denied any suicidal thoughts**. He appeared **motivated** to do better. On a **follow-up interview** with the **psychiatry trainee**, Carlos asked whether the conversations were **confidential**. When informed that they were, he **hesitantly admitted** that he felt **overwhelmed** by new **relationships** with college peers. He indicated that 'in my neighborhood growing up, everybody was Dominican, but in college, I'm the only Dominican.' He also quietly said that he thought he might '**like guys rather than girls**.' He revealed **two recent episodes of panic** 'like when I was a kid' that had occurred during **social situations**. He **declined** to go into further detail.  \n\nAfter these **two initial sessions**, the **psychiatrist** suggested **extending the evaluation** so that they could **optimize a treatment strategy**. She told Carlos that she wanted to better understand his **mood and anxiety symptoms**, as well as how he felt about being the first in his family to go to college (i.e., **role transitions**), and to talk a little more about his concerns about his **sexual orientation**. She also referred Carlos for updated **psychoeducational testing**. This **psychoeducational reassessment confirmed** that Carlos's **reading and writing abilities** were **substantially and quantifiably below** those expected for his age. That report also concluded that these **learning difficulties** were not attributable to **intellectual developmental disorder, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, psychosocial adversity**, or **lack of proficiency** in the language of **academic instruction**. The report concluded that Carlos had **specific difficulties** with **reading fluency and comprehension** as well as **spelling and written expression**.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided context, Carlos's struggles with academic performance, anxiety, insomnia, hopelessness, and history of ADHD suggest a possible diagnosis of **Specific Learning Disorder** (dyslexia) combined with **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**.  The context does not provide enough information to support a diagnosis of any delusional disorder."

        "clinical_case": "**Arden D. Dingle, M.D.**\n\n**Daphne, a 13-year-old in the ninth grade, was brought for a psychiatric evaluation because of academic and behavioral struggles.** She had particular difficulty starting and completing schoolwork and following instructions, and she had received failing grades in math. When prompted to complete tasks, Daphne became argumentative and irritable. She had become increasingly resistant to attending school, asking to stay home with her mother. These difficulties had been evident since early childhood but had worsened significantly this year. Because Daphne had become increasingly distressed, her parents have been less insistent on making her do any activity that upsets her.\n\n**Psychological testing indicated that Daphne had above-average intelligence, age-appropriate achievement in all subjects except math, and some difficulties in visuospatial skills.** The test results were shared with the school, which offered additional tutoring. Daphne attended only a few sessions, stating that they were not helpful. Her parents talked to the school counselors and Daphne's teachers, asking for more services. They were told repeatedly that Daphne needed to be more assertive and ask for help. Several teachers commented that Daphne should be more motivated and try harder. Several years earlier, her pediatrician had diagnosed ADHD and prescribed a stimulant. She took the medication for a week, but her parents stopped giving it to her because she seemed agitated.\n\n**At home, Daphne's parents' close supervision of her homework often led to arguments with crying and screaming.** Her behavior and attitude were noticeably better when she was out of school. She had two long-standing friends but had made no new close friends for several years. In groups with other children, she preferred to play with those younger than she. When her friends chose the activity or did not follow her rules, she tended to withdraw. She was generally quiet in groups and in school but more interactive with family members and individuals she knew well.\n\n**Since early childhood, Daphne has had difficulty falling asleep, requiring a nightlight and parental reassurance.** Recognizing that Daphne was easily upset by change, her parents rarely forced her into new activities. She did well during the summer, which she spent with her grandparents. Her parents reported no particular traumas, stressors, or developmental or medical problems. Daphne had started her menses about 2 months prior to the evaluation. Her family history was pertinent for multiple first- and second-degree relatives with mood, anxiety, or learning disorders.\n\n**At first meeting, Daphne was shy and tense. Her eye contact was poor, and she had difficulty talking about anything other than her plastic horse collection.** Within 15 minutes, she became more comfortable, revealing that she disliked school because the work was too hard. She thought that other children did not seem to like her because she was stupid and was not into clothes and dating. Sometimes they made fun of her and would start laughing whenever the teacher called on her. There were several peers who had similar interests in animals and seemed okay. She has been eating lunch with them but found it hard to relax and to believe that they really wanted to be friends. Daphne was always afraid of making mistakes, getting bad grades, and disappointing everyone. Often, she was so preoccupied with what to say or do next that she did not pay attention to her peers or teachers. She frequently was unable to make a decision for fear of not being right. Daphne was unable to identify any personal strengths or any aspect of her life that was going well. She wished she had more friends and that she was smarter. As long as she could remember, she had always felt this way. These difficulties made her sad, but she denied persistent depressive feelings or suicidal thoughts. She appeared anxious but brightened when discussing her horse figurine collection, her longtime friends, and her family.",

        "clinical_case": "**Robert Haskell, M.D.**\n**John T. Walkup, M.D.**\n\nEthan, a **9-year-old boy**, was referred to a psychiatric clinic by his teacher, who noticed that his **attention was flagging**. At that time, Ethan was a fourth grader at a private regular-education school for boys. The teacher told Ethan's parents that although Ethan had been among the best students in his class in the fall, his grades had slipped during the spring semester. He tended to get **fidgety and distracted** when the academic work became more challenging, and the teacher suggested the parents seek neuropsychiatric testing for him. \n\nAt home, Ethan's mother explained, he seemed more **emotional of late**: 'He just looks weepy sometimes, which is unusual for him.' She denied any difficulties at home, and she described her husband, son, 8-year-old daughter, and herself as a 'happy family'. She had noticed, however, that Ethan seemed **uneasy about being left alone**. He hadbecome 'clingy', often following his parents around the house, and he hated being in any room by himself. Ethan had also started **climbing into bed with his parents in the middle of the night**, something he had never done in the past. Although Ethan had a few good friends in the neighborhood and at school and was glad to have other kids come to his house, he refused to go on sleepovers. \n\nEthan's mother agreed that he appeared more fidgety. She had noticed that he often seemed to be **shrugging his shoulders**, **grimacing**, and **blinking**, which she took to be a sign of anxiety. These movements worsened when he was tired or frustrated, and they diminished in frequency during calm, focused activities such as clarinet practice or homework, especially when she was helping him. \n\nHis mother also mentioned that Ethan had suddenly become 'superstitious'. Whenever he stepped through a doorway, he would go back and forth until he touched both doorjambs with his hands simultaneously, twice in rapid succession. She hoped that Ethan's more conspicuous habits would subside by summer, when the family took its annual vacation. She felt that it was the right year for Disneyland, but Ethan's father had suggested taking him on a fishing trip ('just the boys') while mother and daughter visited relatives in New York City. \n\nEthan's mother recalled her son as an 'easy child, but sensitive'. He was the product of a planned, uncomplicated pregnancy and met all his developmental milestones on time. He had no history of medical problems or recent infections, but his mother mentioned that he had begun to make frequent visits to the school nurse's office complaining of stomachaches. \n\nOn examination, Ethan was a slightly built boy with fair, freckly skin and blond hair. He was somewhat fidgety, tugging at his pants and shifting in his seat. Hearing his mother talk about his new movements seemed to provoke them, and the examiner noted that Ethan also occasionally blinked tightly, rolled his eyes, and made throat-clearing noises. Ethan said that he sometimes worried about 'bad things' happening to his parents. His concerns were vague, however, and he seemed to fear only that burglars might break into their house. \n",
        "diagnosis": "Based on Ethan's symptoms of fidgeting, anxiety,  repetitive behaviors like touching doorjambs, and school performance decline, a possible diagnosis is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with fair to good insight (6B20.0).  His awareness that his behaviors might not be entirely rational suggests 'fair to good' insight. Further evaluation by a qualified professional is necessary for a definitive diagnosis."

        "clinical_case": "**Carol A. Tamminga, M.D.**\n\n**Felicia Allen** was a **32-year-old** single woman brought to the **emergency room (ER)** by police after she apparently tried to **steal a city bus** in Chicago. Because she appeared tobe an '**emotionally disturbed person**', a psychiatry consultation was requested. \n\nAccording to the **police report**, Ms. Allen **threatened the driver with a knife**, took control of the almost empty city bus, and **crashed it**. A more complete story was elicited from a friend of Ms. Allen's who had been on the bus but who had not been arrested. According to her, they had boarded the bus on their way to a nearby shopping mall. Ms. Allen became **frustrated** when the driver refused her dollar bills, instead demanding exact change. She looked in her purse, but instead of finding exact change, she pulled out a **kitchen knife** that she carried for protection. The driver fled, so she got into the empty seat and **drove the bus across the street** into a nearby parked car. \n\nOn examination, Ms. Allen was a **handcuffed, heavyset young woman** with a bandage on her forehead. She **fidgeted and rocked back and forth in her chair**. She appeared to be **mumbling to herself**. When asked what she was saying, the patient made momentary eye contact and just repeated, '**Sorry, sorry**'. She did not respond to other questions. \n\nMore information was elicited from a psychiatrist who had come to the ER soon after the accident. He said that Ms. Allen and her friend were longtime residents at the **state psychiatric hospital** where he worked. They had just begun to take passes every week as part of an effort toward **social remediation**; it had been Ms. Allen's first bus ride without a staff member. \n\nAccording to the psychiatrist, Ms. Allen had received a diagnosis of '**childhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia**'. She had started **hearing voices** by age **5 years**. Big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic, she had been **hospitalized almost constantly** since age **11**. Her **auditory hallucinations** generally consisted of a **critical voice** commenting on her behavior. Her **thinking** was **concrete**, but when relaxed she could be **self-reflective**. She was **motivated to please** and recurrently said her biggest goal was to '**have my own room in my own house with my own friends**'. The psychiatrist said that he was not sure what had caused her to pull out the knife. She had not been **hallucinating** lately and had been feeling less **paranoid**, but he wondered if she had been more **psychotic** than she had let on. It was possible that she was just **impatient** and **irritated**. \n\nThe psychiatrist also believed that she had spent almost no period of life **developing normally** and so had very little experience with the **real world**. \n\nMs. Allen had been taking **clozapine** for **1 year**, with good **resolution of her auditory hallucinations**. She had **gained 35 pounds** on the clozapine, but she had less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and was functioning at a **higher level**. She was hoping to get a **job** and live more **independently**, and the bus trip had been intended as a step in that direction. Because of these improvements and goals, she had insisted on continuing to take the clozapine despite the **weight gain**.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Felicia Allen's diagnosis likely falls under 'Childhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia.' Her history of auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and hospitalization since childhood points towards this diagnosis. Additionally, her current symptoms like fidgeting, mumbling, and lack of responsiveness align with schizophrenic behavior."

Tsuang, M.D., Ph.D., D.Sc.**\n\n**Gregory Baker** was a 20-year-old African American man who was brought to the emergency room (ER) by the campus police of the university from which he had been suspended several months earlier. The police had been called by a professor who reported that Mr. Baker had walked into his classroom shouting, 'I am the Joker, and I am looking for Batman.' When Mr. Baker refused to leave the class, the professor contacted security.\n\nAlthough Mr. Baker had much academic success as a teenager, his behavior had become increasingly odd during the past year. He quit seeing his friends and spent most of his time lying in bed staring at the ceiling. He lived with several family members but rarely spoke to any of them. He had been suspended from college because of lack of attendance. His sister said that she had recurrently seen him mumbling quietly to himself and noted that he would sometimes, at night, stand on the roof of their home and wave his arms as if he were 'conducting a symphony.' He denied having any intention of jumping from the roof or having any thoughts of self-harm, but claimed that he felt liberated and in tune with the music when he was on the roof. Although his father and sister had tried to encourage him to see someone at the university's student health clinic, Mr. Baker had never seen a psychiatrist and had no prior hospitalizations.\n\nDuring the prior several months, Mr. Baker had become increasingly preoccupied with a female friend, Anne, who lived down the street. While he insisted to his family that they were engaged, Anne told Mr. Baker's sister that they had hardly ever spoken and certainly were not dating. Mr. Baker's sister also reported that he had written many letters to Anne but never mailed them; instead, they just accumulated on his desk.\n\nHis family said that they had never known him to use illicit substances or alcohol, and his toxicology screen was negative. When asked about drug use, Mr. Baker appeared angry and did not answer.\n\nOn examination in the ER, Mr. Baker was a well-groomed young man who was generally uncooperative. He appeared constricted, guarded, inattentive, and preoccupied. He became enraged when the ER staff brought him dinner. He loudly insisted that all of the hospital's food was poisoned and that he would only drink a specific type of bottled water. He was noted to have **paranoid, grandiose, and romantic delusions**. He appeared to be internally preoccupied, although he denied hallucinations. Mr. Baker reported feeling 'bad' but denied depression and did not show disturbances in his sleep or appetite. He was adequately oriented to person and place but less so to time. He spoke articulately but refused formal cognitive testing. His insight and judgment were deemed to be poor.\n\nMr. Baker's grandmother had died in a state psychiatric hospital, where she had lived for 30 years. Her diagnosis was unknown. Mr. Baker's mother was reportedly 'crazy.' She had abandoned the family when Mr. Baker was young, and he was raised by his father and paternal grandmother.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Baker agreed to sign himself into the psychiatric unit, stating, 'I don't mind staying here. Anne will probably be there, so I can spend my time with her.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on Mr. Baker's presentation of  delusions, paranoia, bizarre behavior, and poor insight, a likely diagnosis from the ICD-11 is **Delusional Disorder (6A24)**. His symptoms including grandiose delusions ('I am the Joker'), paranoid beliefs ('hospital food was poisoned'), and unusual behaviors like conducting an imaginary symphony on his roof suggest this disorder."

Morris Smith, M.D. Dolores Malaspina, M.D., M.P.H.**\n\n**Hakim Coleman**, a 25-year-old U.S. Army veteran and community college student, presented to the emergency room (ER) with his girlfriend and sister.  He was described as a tall, slim, well-groomed young man with glasses.  His speech was soft and characterized by increased latency.  His affect was blunted, except for moments of anxiety when discussing his symptoms.\n\nMr. Coleman reported coming to the ER at his sister's suggestion, seeking a 'general checkup' due to several days of 'migraines' and 'hallucinations of a spiritual nature' persisting for 3 months.  His headaches were described as 'sharp, shooting' sensations in various bilateral locations, accompanied by a 'ringing' sensation along the midline of his brain, worsening when he contemplated his 'vices'.\n\nThese 'vices' included 'alcohol, cigarettes, disrespecting my parents, girls.' He denied guilt, anxiety, or preoccupation with his military duties in Iraq, although his sister revealed the confidential nature of those responsibilities. Four months prior, he joined an evangelical church due to feelings of guilt about 'all the things I've done.'  Three months later, he began experiencing 'voices trying to make me feel guilty' almost daily, with the most recent auditory hallucination occurring the day before his ER visit.  He had become withdrawn, noticing strangers commenting on his past sins.\n\nMr. Coleman suspected alcohol withdrawal as a potential cause of his migraines and guilt.  He had consumed three to four beers most days for several years until quitting 4 months prior, after joining the church. He still occasionally drank 'a beer or two' every other week, experiencing guilt afterward. He denied typical alcohol withdrawal symptoms like tremors and sweats.  He had used cannabis up to twice monthly for years, ceasing completely upon joining the church. He denied other illicit drug use, except for a single uneventful cocaine use 3 years prior. He reported occasional short sleep durations and some nightmares, but denied depressive, manic, or psychotic symptoms and violent ideation.\n\nRegarding PTSD, Mr. Coleman's score on the 20-item self-administered PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 was below the cutoff for probable PTSD in veterans. He denied an unusually frightening, horrible, or traumatic military experience.  He felt overwhelmed by his current responsibilities, including school and frequent church activities.  His academic performance had declined from straight As to Bs and Cs.\n\nInterviews with his girlfriend and sister corroborated his social isolation and quiet demeanor, a stark contrast to his previously fun and outgoing personality.  They noted his newfound religiosity.  His sister suspected 'brainwashing' by the church, while his girlfriend, who attended services with him, reported that other church members expressed concern, noting that while some new members felt guilt over past behaviors, none had reported hallucinations.\n\nA physical examination, including a neurological screen, was unremarkable, as were routine laboratory tests, blood alcohol level, and urine toxicology. A noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) scan was normal.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Hakim Coleman's symptoms, including hallucinations and guilt, suggest a possible diagnosis of Delusional Disorder.  However, without a complete evaluation by a medical professional, it is impossible to give a definitive diagnosis. Further assessment is needed to rule out other potential diagnoses like Bipolar disorder or PTSD."

Mr. Daishi had told the professor he was distracted by the '**listening devices**' and '**thought control machines**' in his apartment.\n\nInitially wary, Mr. Daishi was relieved to talk in a room he believed was not bugged. His problems began 3 months earlier, after returning from Japan.  He suspected trouble when a classmate sneezed and grinned oddly at him. He then noticed two strangers outside his apartment.\n\nMr. Daishi concluded these strangers installed tiny mind-control devices to weaken him for an onslaught of misinformation. He believed these devices made him watch Fox News, where reporters indirectly and critically commented about him.  He felt targeted due to his '**superior intelligence**' and future role as prime minister of Japan. He believed this group wanted an ally in Tokyo.  He struggled to prevent the reporters from planting ideas in his head.\n\nHe became increasingly vigilant, fearing everyone at school and in his apartment complex was part of the plot.  He slept little, withdrew, and stopped attending classes, but maintained eating and hygiene.\n\nHe denied feeling elated or euphoric, describing his energy as '**okay**' and thinking as clear '**except when they try to put ideas into my head**'. He admitted to extreme fear during a recent trip to Japan after smoking '**a lot of pot**', hearing strange sounds, and believing friends were laughing at him. He denied cannabis use since returning to the United States, and any other substance use, rarely even drinking alcohol. He denied other auditory or visual hallucinations.\n\nMr. Daishi's uncle, his local guardian, described him as healthy, intelligent, somewhat shy, with no prior psychiatric history. He described Mr. Daishi's parents as loving and supportive, though his father might be a little stern. There was no family history of major mental illness.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Daishi was well-groomed and cooperative, with normal psychomotor activity. His speech was coherent and goal-directed. His mood was '**afraid**'. His affective expression was normal. He denied guilt, suicide, or worthlessness. He was convinced of continuous monitoring and 'mind control' devices in his apartment, and denied hallucinations. His cognitive functions were generally normal. He lacked insight into his beliefs.\n\nInvestigations showed normal laboratory results, an unremarkable head CT scan, and a negative urine drug screen.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Daishi's symptoms align most closely with Delusional Disorder.  He exhibits fixed, false beliefs (mind control devices, targeted surveillance) that are not consistent with reality and significantly impact his functioning. The absence of hallucinations or other psychotic features points away from schizophrenia. "

        "clinical_case": "**Anthony O. Ahmed, Ph.D.**\n\n**John Evans** was a 25-year-old single, unemployed white man who had been seeing a psychiatrist for several years for management of psychosis, depression, anxiety, and abuse of marijuana and alcohol.\n\nAfter an apparently normal childhood, **Mr. Evans began to show dysphoric mood, anhedonia, low energy, and social isolation by age 15 years.** At about the same time, **Mr. Evans began to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana every day.** In addition, he developed recurrent panic attacks, marked by a sudden onset of palpitations, diaphoresis, and thoughts that he was going to die. When he was at his most depressed and panicky, he twice received a combination of sertraline 100 mg/day and psychotherapy. In both cases, his most intense depressive symptoms lifted within a few weeks, and he discontinued the sertraline after a few months. Between episodes of severe depression, he was generally seen as sad, irritable, and amotivated. His school performance declined around tenth grade and remained marginal throughout the rest of high school. He did not attend college as his parents had expected him to, but instead lived at home and did odd jobs in the neighborhood.\n\nAround age 20, **Mr. Evans developed a psychotic episode in which he had the conviction that he had murdered people when he was 6 years old.** Although he could not remember who these people were or the circumstances, he was absolutely convinced that this had happened, something that was confirmed by continuous voices accusing him of being a murderer. He also became convinced that other people would punish him for what had happened, and thus he feared for his life. Over the ensuing few weeks, he became guilt-ridden and preoccupied with the idea that he should kill himself by slashing his wrists, which culminated in his being psychiatrically hospitalized.\n\nAlthough he was predominantly anxious on admission, **Mr. Evans soon became very depressed, with prominent anhedonia, poor sleep, and decreased appetite and concentration.** With the combined use of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications, both the depression and the psychotic symptoms remitted after 4 weeks. Therefore, the total duration of the psychotic episode was approximately 7 weeks, 4 of which were also characterized by major depressive disorder. Mr. Evans had been hospitalized with the same pattern of symptoms two additional times before age 22, and each of these episodes started with several weeks of delusions and hallucinations related to his conviction that he had murdered someone when he was a child, followed by severe depression lasting an additional month. Both relapses occurred while he was apparently adherent to reasonable dosages of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. During the 3 years prior to this evaluation, Mr. Evans had been adherent to clozapine and had been without hallucinations and delusions. He had also been adherent to his antidepressant medication and supportive psychotherapy, although his dysphoria, irritability, and amotivation never completely resolved.\n\n**Mr. Evans's history was significant for marijuana and alcohol misuse that began at age 15.** Before the onset of psychosis at age 20, he smoked several joints of marijuana almost daily and binge-drank on weekends, with occasional blackouts. After the onset of the psychosis, he decreased his marijuana and alcohol use significantly, with two several-month-long periods of abstinence, yet he continued to have psychotic episodes up through age 22. He started attending Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous groups, achieved sobriety from marijuana and alcohol at age 23, and had remained sober for the 2 years prior to this evaluation.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Evans's symptoms align with a diagnosis of Bipolar II disorder.  His history includes episodes of major depression and hypomania, as evidenced by his mood fluctuations, psychotic features, and substance use patterns.  While he is currently in full remission, his previous diagnoses and symptom presentation strongly suggest Bipolar II disorder."

To commemorate the event, they decided to get tattoos. Afterward, they went to a nearby park, where Mr. Foster bought and smoked a marijuana cigarette. During the ensuing hour, Mr. Foster began to believe that the symbols in his tattoo had mysterious meaning and power. He became convinced that the tattoo artist was conspiring with others against him and that his wife was cheating on him. After returning to the hotel, the patient searched his wife's phone for evidence of her infidelity and threatened to jump out the window. The patient's wife, an ER physician, successfully convinced the patient to go to sleep, thinking that the episode would resolve.The following day, the patient remained paranoid and delusional. He again threatened to jump out the window, and indicated that he would have no choice but to kill his wife the next time she slept. She called 911, and her husband was brought to the ER of a large nearby hospital. Later that day, he was admitted to an acute inpatient psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of unspecified psychotic disorder.Mr. Foster had smoked cannabis sporadically from age 18 but began to smoke daily 5 years prior to this admission. In the past year, his cannabis use had steadily increased;previously he had been smoking once per day, but more recently his use had increased to three times a day, beginning when he awoke. He noted that he has begun to feel 'anxious' when not under the influence of cannabis and believed his thrice-daily use helped him 'even out.' The patient and his wife denied that he had ever used other illicit substances, and the patient indicated that he rarely drank alcohol. Until 1 year earlier, he had never seen a psychiatrist or been viewed by his friends and family as having significant psychiatric issues.In the past year, however, Mr. Foster had been hospitalized four times for psychiatric problems. He had been hospitalized twice with classic manic symptoms and once for a suicidal depression. In addition, 7 months prior to this presentation, the patient had been hospitalized for a 6-week episode of cannabis-induced psychosis, which responded well to risperidone. At that time, his main symptom was paranoia. Two months prior to this admission, he entered a 1-month inpatient substance abuse treatment program for cannabis use disorder. Until the weekend of this admission, he had continued to smoke marijuana but had not used alcohol or any other substances since discharge from the rehabilitation facility. He had also been functioning well while taking lithium monotherapy for 3 months.Mr. Foster had been steadily employed as a film editor since graduating from college. His father had a bipolar disorder, and his paternal grandfather committed suicide via gunshot but with an unknown diagnosis.On the second day of hospitalization, Mr. Foster began to realize that his wife was not cheating on him and that the symbols in his tattoo were not meaningful. By the third day, he spontaneously said the paranoia was the result of cannabis intoxication. He declined further risperidone but continued lithium monotherapy. He was discharged with an appointment to follow up with his outpatient psychiatrist.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Kevin Foster's diagnosis appears to be cannabis-induced psychotic disorder.  His symptoms, including paranoia and delusions, emerged after smoking marijuana and resolved with discontinuation of use and continued lithium monotherapy. The historical pattern of cannabis use exacerbating his mental health symptoms further supports this diagnosis."

        "clinical_case": "**Julie B. Penzner, M.D.**\n\n**Lara Gonzalez**, a 51-year-old divorced freelance journalist, brought herself to the emergency room requesting dermatological evaluation for flea infestation.  When no corroborating evidence was found on skin examination and the patient insisted that she was unsafe at home, she was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric service with 'unspecified psychotic disorder.'\n\nHer concerns began around 1 week prior to presentation. To contend with financial stress, she had taken in temporary renters for a spare room in her home and had begun pet sitting for some neighbors. Under these conditions, she perceived tiny insects burrowing into her skin and walls and covering her rugs and mattress. She had spent the 36 hours prior to presentation frantically cleaning her home, fearing that her tenants would not pay if they saw the fleas. She showered repeatedly, using shampoos meant to treat animal infestations, and she consulted three different exterminators, although none found evidence of fleas. She threw away a bag of clothing, believing she heard fleas 'rustling and scratching inside.' She bought replacement clothes that she kept in their own trash bag, thereby spending almost all of her savings, which worsened her preexisting financial strain.\n\nAside from her concerns about infestation, Ms. Gonzalez denied symptoms of depression, mania, and suspiciousness. She denied using any drugs or alcohol. No one in her family had a history of psychiatric illness. Ms. Gonzalez had been diagnosed with depression in college and briefly treated with an antidepressant. She had no relevant medical problems.\n\nHer worries about infestation began in the setting of her sister's diagnosis with invasive cancer, the onset of her own menopause, financial strain that was likely forcing her to move from the United States back to Argentina (her country of origin), and a recent breakup with her boyfriend. At baseline, she described herself as an obsessive person who had always had 'contamination phobias' that historically worsened during times of anxiety.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Gonzalez was calm and easily engaged, with normal relatedness and eye contact. She offered up a small plastic bag containing 'fleas and larvae' that she had collected in the hospital while awaiting evaluation. Inspection of the bag revealed lint and plaster. Her speech had an urgent quality to it, and she described her mood as 'sad right now.' She was tearful intermittently but otherwise smiling reactively. Her thoughts were overly inclusive and intensely focused on fleas. She expressed belief that each time a hair fell out of her head, it would morph into larvae. When crying, she believed an egg came out of her tear duct. She was not suicidal or homicidal. She expressed an unshakable belief that lint was larvae, and that she was infested. She denied hallucinations. Cognition was intact. Her insight was impaired, but her judgment was deemed reasonably appropriate.\n\nDermatological examination revealed no insects or larvae embedded in Ms. Gonzalez's skin. Results of neurological examination, head computed tomography scan, laboratory tests, and toxicology data were normal. She was discharged from the emergency room on a low-dose antipsychotic medication and seen weekly for supportive psychotherapy. Her preoccupation improved within days and resolved entirely within 2 weeks. She developed enough insight to refer to her belief that fleas were in her skin as a 'crazy thought.' She attributed her 'break from reality' to multiple stressors, and was able to articulate that she relied on her delusion as a way to distract herself from real problems. Her family corroborated her quick return to baseline.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Ms. Gonzalez's symptoms align with Delusional Disorder, in full remission (6A24.2).  Her preoccupation with fleas and her corresponding actions, though distressing, resolved within two weeks after treatment initiation. The fact that she was able to articulate her delusion as 'crazy' suggests improved insight."

        "clinical_case": "**Patient Presentation and Initial Management**\n\nAn African American man in his 30s was brought to an urban emergency room (ER) by police after neighbors reported him for loudly knocking on doors.  The referral form labeled him as \"schizophrenic\" and \"emotionally disturbed.\"  Police reported he offered them money for sex. He identified himself as the \"New Jesus\" and refused to give another name.  He was agitated and ran through the ER, leading to his restraint and administration of **intramuscular lorazepam 2 mg and haloperidol 5 mg**.  Intravenous diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50 mg was prepared for potential extrapyramidal side effects. The admitting team noted \"unspecified psychosis\" and transferred him to the ER psychiatry team.\n\n**Continued Agitation and Initial Interview**\n\nDespite restraints, the patient remained agitated, claiming to receive messages from God and stating he no longer needed sleep after being \"touched by Heaven.\" His speech was rapid, disorganized, and difficult to understand.  Labs were drawn (complete blood count, blood chemistries, and toxicology screen). After 45 more minutes of agitation, he received another lorazepam dose, which calmed him but did not induce sleep. The restraints were then removed.\n\nAn hour after the initial medication, the patient was interviewed. He was an overweight, disheveled, and malodorous African American man.  He did not smell of alcohol.  He made poor eye contact, instead looking at anything that moved. His speech was disorganized, rapid, and hard to follow. He was restless but not threatening.  He described his mood as \"not bad\" but displayed labile affect, laughing inappropriately and becoming frustrated when misunderstood.  He exhibited disorganized thought processes, grandiose delusions, and auditory hallucinations (\"God talking to me\"). He denied other hallucinations, suicidal ideation, and homicidal ideation.  He gave a rambling answer for the date, missing it by one day, but remembered the officers' names. He refused further cognitive testing. His insight and judgment appeared poor.\n\n**Anamnesis and Past History**\n\nThe patient's sister arrived, reporting he had been acting strangely for a week, arguing with family, claiming not to need sleep, and talking about \"gifts.\" She had been unable to contact him.  She mentioned seeing a bottle of olanzapine in his house and that their father had been labeled \"schizophrenic\" and \"bipolar.\" She stated he did not typically use drugs, was 34 years old, and worked as a middle school math teacher.\n\nHis electronic medical record revealed a similar episode two years prior, with a negative toxicology screen, a two-week hospitalization, a discharge diagnosis of \"schizoaffective disorder,\" a prescription for olanzapine, and a referral for outpatient follow-up.  The record also mentioned two prior admissions to a county hospital, but those records were unavailable.\n\n**Subsequent Course and Examination**\n\nOver the next 24 hours, the patient calmed significantly, though he maintained his belief of being misunderstood and not needing hospitalization.  He acknowledged a \"direct connection to God\" and \"an important role on Earth\" but denied being the \"New Jesus.\" His speech remained rapid and loud, though he was more easily redirected. He remained tense and jumpy but denied paranoia or fear.\n\nPhysical examination was unremarkable except for blisters on his feet.  Neurological examination was normal.  The toxicology screen was negative, and his blood alcohol level was zero.  Initial labs showed elevated blood urea nitrogen and a blood sugar level of 210 mg/dL.  His mean corpuscular volume, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio, and magnesium levels were normal. His BMI was 30.8.",

He noted that these 'dark periods' had gone on as long as he had known her but that she had experienced at least a half dozen of these episodes in the prior year. He said they typically improved within a few weeks of restarting her fluoxetine. He added that he wondered whether alcohol and clonazepam worsened her symptoms, because she routinely ramped up their use when the dark periods began.\n\nMs. Ingram's husband said he had decided to bring her to the ER after he discovered that she had recently created a blog entitled *Nancy Ingram's Best Stock Picks*. Such an activity not only was out of character but also, given her job as a stock analyst for a large investment bank, was strictly against company policy. He said that she had been working on these stock picks around the clock, forgoing her own meals as well as her responsibilities at work and with her children. She countered that she was fine and that her blog would 'make them as rich as Croesus.'\n\nThe patient had first been diagnosed with depression in college, after the death of her father from suicide. He had been a wildly erratic, alcohol-abusing businessman whom the patient loved very much. Her paternal grandmother had several 'nervous breakdowns,' but her diagnosis and treatment history were unknown. Since college, her mood had generally been 'down,' interspersed with recurrent bouts of worsened dysphoria, insomnia, and uncharacteristically rapid speech and hyperalertness. She had tried psychotherapy sporadically and taken a series of antidepressant medications, but her husband noted that the baseline depression persisted and that the dark periods were increasing in frequency.\n\nHer outpatient psychiatrist noted that Ms. Ingram appeared to have dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder) and recurrent major depressive disorder. He also said that he had never seen her during her periods of edginess and insomnia—she always refused to see him until the 'really down' periods improved—and that she had refused him access to her husband or to any other source of collateral information.\n\nOn examination, the patient was pacing angrily in the exam room. She was dressed in jeans and a shirt that was carelessly unbuttoned. Her eyes appeared glazed and unfocused. She responded to the examiner's entrance by sitting down and explaining that this was all a miscommunication, that she was fine and needed to get home immediately to tend to her business. Her speech was rapid, pressured, and very difficult to interrupt. She admitted to not sleeping but denied that it was a problem. She denied hallucinations but admitted, with a smile, to a unique ability to predict the stock market. She refused cognitive testing, saying she would decline the opportunity to be 'a trained seal, a guinea pig, Mr. Ed, and a barking dog, thank you very much, and may I leave now?' Her insight into her situation appeared poor, and her judgment was deemed to be impaired.\n",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided context, Nancy Ingram appears to be experiencing a mood disorder with features suggestive of both dysthymia and recurrent major depressive disorder.  Her symptoms include depressed mood, insomnia, rapid speech, and poor judgment.

Oquendo, M.D.**\n\n**Olivia Jacobs**, a 22-year-old graduate student in architecture, was referred for an urgent psychiatric consultation after she told her roommate that she was suicidal. Ms. Jacobs had a history of mood symptoms that had been under good control with lithium and sertraline, but her depressive symptoms had returned soon after she had arrived in a new city for school, 3 months earlier. She had become preoccupied with ways in which she might kill herself without inconveniencing others. Her dominant suicidal thoughts involved shooting herself in the head while leaning out the window, so as not to cause a mess in the dorm. Although she did not have access to a gun, she spent time searching the Web for places where she might purchase one.\n\n**Ms. Jacobs's psychiatric history** began at age 15, when she began to regularly drink alcohol and smoke marijuana, usually when out at dance clubs with friends. Both of these substances calmed her, and she denied that either had become problematic. She had used neither alcohol nor marijuana since starting graduate school.\n\nAround age 17, she began experiencing **brief, intense depressive episodes**, marked by tearfulness, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, and poor concentration. She would sleep more than 12 hours a day and neglect responsibilities at school and home. These depressive episodes would generally shift after a few weeks into periods of **increased energy, pressured speech, and unusual creativity**. She would stay up most of the night working on projects and building architectural models. These revved-up episodes lasted about 5 days and were punctuated by feelings that her friends had turned against her and that they were not really friends at all. Worried especially about the paranoia, her family had brought her to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her as having **bipolar II disorder** and prescribed lithium and sertraline. Although Ms. Jacobs's moods did not completely stabilize on this regimen, she did well enough at a local university to be accepted into a prestigious graduate program far from home. At that point the depression returned, and she became intensely suicidal for the first time.\n\n**Upon evaluation**, the patient was visibly depressed and tearful, and had psychomotor slowing. She said it was very difficult to get out of bed and she was not attending class most days. She reported hopelessness, poor concentration, and guilt about spending family money for school when she was not able to perform. She stated that she thought about suicide most of the time and that she had found nothing to distract her. She denied recent drinking or smoking marijuana, stating she did not feel like 'partying.' She acknowledged profound feelings of emptiness and indicated that she had occasionally cut her arms superficially to 'see what it would feel like.' She stated that she knew that cutting herself in this way would not kill her. She reported depersonalization and occasional panic attacks. She denied having mood instability, derealization, problems with impulsivity, concerns about her identity, and fears of abandonment.",

Most recently, she described **depressed mood** during the month since she began a new job. She said she was **preoccupied with concerns** that her new boss and colleagues thought her work was **inadequate and slow** and that she was **unfriendly**.\n\nShe had **no energy and enthusiasm at home**, either, and instead of playing with her children or talking to her husband, she tended to **watch television for hours, overeat, and sleep excessively**. This had led to a **6-pound weight gain in just 3 weeks**, which made her feel **even worse about herself**. She had begun to **cry several times a week**, which she reported as the sign that she **'knew the depression had returned.'** She had also begun to **think often of death**, although she had never attempted suicide.\n\nMs. Kershaw said her memory about her history of depressions was **a little fuzzy**, so she brought in her husband, who had known her since college. They agreed that she had **first become depressed in her teens** and that she had experienced **at least five discrete periods of depression as an adult**. These episodes generally included **depressed mood**, **anergia**, **amotivation**, **hypersomnia**, **hyperphagia**, **deep feelings of guilt**, **decreased libido**, and **mild to moderate suicidal ideation without plan**.\n\nHer depressions were often **punctuated by periods of 'too much' energy, irritability, pressured speech, and flight of ideas**. These episodes of **excess energy** could last **hours, days, or a couple of weeks**. The **depressed mood would not lift** during these periods, but she would **'at least be able to do a few things.'**\n\nWhen specifically asked, Ms. Kershaw's husband described **distinctive times** when she seemed **unusually excited, happy, and self-confident**, and like a **'different person.'** She would **talk fast, seem energized and optimistic, do the daily chores very efficiently, and start (and often finish) new projects**. She would **need little sleep** and still be **enthusiastic the next day**.\n\nMs. Kershaw recalled these periods but said they felt **'normal.'** In response to a question about **hypersexuality**, Ms. Kershaw **smiled for the only time** during the interview, saying that although her husband seemed to be including her **good periods** as part of her illness, he had **not been complaining** when she had her **longest such episode (about 6 days) when they first started dating in college**. Since then, she reported that these episodes were **'fairly frequent'** and lasted **2 or 3 days**.\n\nBecause of her periodic low mood and thoughts of death, she had seen various psychiatrists since her **mid-teenage years**. Psychotherapy tended to work **'okay'** until she had another depressive episode, when she would be unable to attend sessions and would then just quit. **Three antidepressant trials** of adequate dosage and duration (6 months to 3 years) were each associated with **short-term relief of depression**, followed by relapse. Both alone and in the presence of her husband, Ms. Kershaw denied any history of **alcohol or substance misuse**.

The mother's chief concern was that 'Rachel's meds aren't working.' Rachel said she had no particular complaints.\n\nIn meetings with the patient and her mother, both together and separately, both reported that **Rachel's grades had dropped from As and Bs to Cs and Ds**, that she had lost many of her long-standing friends, and that conflicts at home had escalated to the point that her mother characterized her as 'nasty and mean.'\n\n**Rachel first saw a psychiatrist at age 7 years** when she was evaluated for attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) because of long-standing restlessness, impulsivity, and distractibility. After behavioral interventions were ineffective, the patient began treatment with a methylphenidate-based medication at age 8.\n\n**Improvement was seen at school, in her social life, and at home.** For the ensuing 6 years, Rachel had done well and was 'pretty much like other kids as long as she took her medicine.'\n\nAt around age 14, however, Rachel became 'moody.' Instead of being a 'bubbly teenager,' she would spend days by herself and hardly speak to anyone. During these periods of persistent sadness, she would sleep more than usual, complain that her friends didn't like her anymore, and not seem interested in anything. At other times, she would be a 'holy terror' at home, frequently yelling at her sister and parents to the point that everyone was 'walking on eggshells.' At about that time, **Rachel's grades plummeted**, and her pediatrician increased the dosage of her ADHD medication.\n\n**Rachel's family history was pertinent for a father who 'had real problems.'** Although her mother did not know his diagnosis, he had been treated with lithium. The father had left the family before Rachel was born, and the two had never met.\n\nIn exploring the periods of irritability, dysphoria, and social isolation, the clinician asked whether there had been times in which Rachel was in an especially good mood. The mother recalled multiple periods in which her daughter would be 'giddy' for a week or two. She would 'laugh at anything' and would enthusiastically help out with and even initiate household chores. Because these were the 'good phases,' the mother did not think these episodes were noteworthy.\n\nRachel had no general medical problems. She denied use of alcohol, illicit substances, and medications other than the prescribed ADHD medication.\n\nOn examination while alone, Rachel was a casually groomed teenager who was coherent and goal directed. She appeared wary and sad, with some affective constriction. She did not like how she had been feeling, saying she felt depressed for a week, then okay, then 'hilarious' for a few days, then 'murderous,' like someone was 'churning up my insides.' She did not know why she felt like that, and she hated not knowing how she would be feeling the next day. She denied psychotic symptoms, confusion, and suicidal and homicidal thoughts. She was cognitively intact.",

I can stop my antivirals!** While Mr. Lopez fidgeted on a chair, furiously writing on a yellow pad, his partner provided the recent history. He said that the patient had been doing well until approximately **1 month earlier**. At that point, he began an unusually intense **editing project**. After about **10 days of little sleep, boundless energy, and activity**, Mr. Lopez seemed edgy, a little pressured, and glassy-eyed. That night, the two of them went to a party to celebrate the completion of the work project. Despite several years of **Narcotics Anonymous meetings** and abstinence from illicit substances, Mr. Lopez took **crystal methamphetamine**, a stimulant.\n\nAcutely anxious and paranoid that they were being followed, Mr. Lopez drank **three martinis** but still did not sleep that night. Over the ensuing days, the patient became **less paranoid**, but he appeared increasingly distracted and his speech was more pressured. Mr. Lopez's work project was returned with multiple **negative comments** and requests for corrections. Instead of focusing on his editing, however, he stayed up late every night, intent on finding a cure for **HIV**. He made inappropriate, **hypersexual advances toward other men at the gym**, where he spent much of the day. He **lost at least 5 pounds** after deciding he should take **vitamin supplements instead of food and his antiretroviral medication**. He refused to go to the emergency room but finally agreed to come to his routine **AIDS clinic appointment** to show his doctors how well he had done despite not having taken his medications in over a month.\n\nMr. Lopez's psychiatric history was without a prior episode of **clear-cut mania**, but he had been depressed as a teenager during the early phase of his coming-out process. That episode was punctuated by a **purposeful overdose** and a **2-week psychiatric hospitalization** and treatment with **antidepressant medication** and **psychotherapy**. Mr. Lopez had discontinued the medication because it made him **hyper and edgy**, and he stopped the psychotherapy because it was **pointless**. He used **methamphetamine frequently for several years**, which led to recurrent **unprotected intercourse with strangers**.\n\nMr. Lopez was diagnosed with **HIV** at age 22, at which point he went to an outpatient **substance use disorder rehabilitation center** and discontinued his use of **stimulants and alcohol**. His lowest **CD4 lymphocyte count** had been **216 cells/mm3**, when he was age 24, at which time his **viral load** was **1.6 million copies**. He had been reportedly **adherent to his antiretroviral medications** since then. His most recent **CD4 count**, 6 months prior to this episode, had been **526 cells/mm3**. His **viral load** had been undetectable. He had suffered **fatigue** but had not had any **AIDS-defining illnesses**. A **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** scan of the brain revealed **mild cortical atrophy** and **periventricular white matter disease** in excess of what would be expected for his age. The partner was unsure when Mr. Lopez had discontinued his antiretrovirals but thought it might have been months earlier. He also wondered if Mr. Lopez had **lost a step cognitively** over the past year.\n\nHis **family psychiatric history** was significant for a **maternal aunt** who had received **lithium** and several courses of **electroconvulsive therapy**, but her diagnosis was unknown.\n\nOn examination, the patient was a **sloppily dressed young man** who told a **pressured, disjointed story** of events over the prior month. He was **difficult to direct** and was uncharacteristically **irritable and devaluing**. He was **preoccupied with having discovered a cure for HIV** through **multivitamins and exercise**. He denied **hallucinations** and **suicidal and homicidal ideation**. He refused **cognitive testing**, and his **insight and judgment** appeared **poor**.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on Mr. Lopez's symptoms of pressured speech, grandiosity (believing he has cured HIV), decreased need for sleep, and inappropriate sexual behavior, a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder, manic episode is most likely.  His history of substance abuse and past depressive episode also support this diagnosis. It is important to note that a definitive diagnosis can only be made by a qualified medical professional after a thorough evaluation."

        "clinical_case": "**Jessica Daniels, M.D.**\n\n**Taaj Mustafa**, a 22-year-old recent college graduate, was brought to the emergency room (ER) by his friends after he appeared bizarrely silent after disappearing for 3 days. Mr. Mustafa's friends reported that he had recently undergone treatment for testicular cancer, but that he had been in a good mood when they had last seen him 4 nights earlier. He had not shown up for a planned get-together the following day and had then not responded to e-mails, texts, or phone calls. They had not known how to contact his parents or relatives and had no other history.\n\nIn the ER, Mr. Mustafa related to others in an odd manner, standing stiffly and not making eye contact or answering questions. After about 10 minutes, he suddenly grabbed a staff member by the arm. While he seemed to lack a purpose or intent to harm, he refused to let go, and the staff member was unable to extricate herself until a security guard intervened. At that point, he received intramuscular haloperidol and lorazepam. During the ensuing hour, his extremities became rigid, and while lying on a hospital bed, he held his arms above his head, with his elbows bent. He was admitted to the medical service. A head computed tomography (CT) scan, routine laboratory tests, and urine toxicology were noncontributory, except that his creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was elevated, at 906 IU/L. His heart rate was also elevated, at 110 beats per minute. He had no fever, and his blood pressure was within the normal range.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Mustafa was found to be a thin young man lying in bed, with his head held awkwardly off the pillow. He was stiffly raising his arms up and down. His hair was falling out in tufts. He stared straight ahead with infrequent blinks, making no eye contact. He was not diaphoretic and did not appear to be in pain. Physical examination revealed an initial resistance against any movement of his arms. When either arm was moved into a position by the examiner, it remained in that position. No myoclonus was evident. Speaking with a long latency and significantly decreased production, he expressed fear that he was dying. As he slowly expressed his anxiety, his body remained stiff and rigid. He denied auditory or visual hallucinations. He was fully awake and alert and was oriented to time and place but did not participate in other cognitive tests.\n\nMr. Mustafa was clinically unchanged for 3 days while he received intravenous fluids. No psychoactive medication was given. Laboratory tests, an electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were unrevealing, and his CPK trended downward after peaking at 1,100 IU/L. On the fourth hospital day, Mr. Mustafa was given a test dose of intravenous lorazepam 1 mg and then a repeat dose of 1 mg after 5 minutes. He did not become sedated. His mental status did not change, except that his speech was slightly more productive after the second dose. Intravenous lorazepam 1 mg every 4-6 hours was started. After 24 hours, his rigidity had resolved, his speech was fluent and pressured, and he became very active and agitated. He paced the hallways, followed the nurses around, and tried to leave the hospital. He told staff, other patients, and visitors that he was a great artist and that he had cured his cancer. His CPK normalized and tachycardia resolved. He remained afebrile.\n\nMr. Mustafa's parents arrived from out of town on the sixth hospital day. They reported that his only previous psychiatric history had been a depression that developed when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer 1 year earlier. Mr. Mustafa had been taking sertraline 50 mg/day and was doing well until 10 days prior to admission, when he learned that he had a recurrence of testicular cancer with metastasis to the retroperitoneum. He immediately underwent chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, and dexamethasone. After receiving the chemotherapy, Mr. Mustafa had told his parents over the phone that he felt excellent but had then not returned their phone calls or e-mails. This was not entirely unusual behavior for their son, who was a sketchy correspondent, but they had become increasingly worried and finally flew across the country when they had not heard from him in 10 days. The parents also mentioned that the only pertinent family history was a maternal uncle with severe bipolar disorder, which had been treated with electroconvulsive therapy.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Mustafa's presentation aligns with Delusional Disorder in full remission (6A24.2).  His symptoms, including bizarre behavior, rigidity, and elevated CPK, appear to have resolved after receiving lorazepam and are consistent with a recent episode of psychosis."

        "clinical_case": "**Ian Jones, M.R.C.Psych., Ph.D.**\n\n**Ursula Norman**, a 32-year-old nurse, was brought to an emergency department 6 days after giving birth. Her husband stated that she had been behaving very strangely and that she had become convinced that she had smothered and killed her baby.\n\nHer husband reported that after a normal pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery, Ms. Norman had happily gone home with their first child. On the third day after delivery, however, her mood and affect began to shift rapidly between elation and weepiness. She became irritable and anxious. She slept only an hour a night, even when her baby was asleep. Her behavior became increasingly bizarre, with overactivity and agitation. Her speech was rapid and digressive. Although not previously a religious person, she became convinced that God was speaking through her and that she had special powers that could solve the problems of the world. She told her husband that she could identify evil people by looking into their eyes and had begun to worry that she was surrounded by evil people, including her own mother. Most disturbing for her, whenever she was out of sight of her son, she became totally convinced that she had smothered him, and no one could convince her otherwise.\n\n**Ms. Norman had a history of three episodes of major depressive disorder in her teens and early 20s.** These episodes resolved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. She also had a psychiatric admission for mania 3 years prior to the delivery of her child, after a flight from Asia to Europe. Following treatment with antipsychotic medication, she became depressed for several months. Although a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was discussed at this time, she was reluctant to accept this label, attributing the episode to stress and jet lag. She had discontinued the psychiatric medication in anticipation of getting pregnant.\n\n**Ms. Norman's own mother had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital shortly after the birth of her first child.** This episode was not talked about in the family, and there were few other details. She had no other family history of note.\n\nUntil just before delivery of her child, Ms. Norman had been a highly functional nurse in a renal unit. Her husband was the head of a sales team, and they lived in comfortable social circumstances. She had no history of illicit drug use and, prior to pregnancy, drank only 2 or 3 units of alcohol a week.\n\n**On mental status examination, Ms. Norman wandered around the room, seemingly unable to sit for more than a few moments.** She was distractible and overtalkative, and demonstrated flight of ideas, flitting from one subject to another. Her mood was labile. At times she appeared happily euphoric. At other times she was tearful, and she could become quickly irritable when she felt she was not being understood. It was clear that she had a number of delusional beliefs but was unwilling to discuss most of them with the examiner. She did insist that she had already killed her own child, which led to several minutes of tears, but she returned to an edgy euphoria within a few minutes. She denied intent to harm herself or anyone else. She appeared inattentive, with poor concentration, but would not participate in formal cognitive testing.\n\n**Physical examination and laboratory testing results were all within normal limits.**",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Ursula Norman's symptoms align with a diagnosis of **postpartum psychosis**.  This is characterized by severe mood swings, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking shortly after childbirth.  Her history of bipolar disorder also contributes to this diagnosis."

        "clinical_case": "**Holly A. Swartz, M.D.**\n\n**Victoria Owens**, a divorced 58-year-old event planner, scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for help with anxiety and depression. Ms. Owens arrived at the appointment well dressed and a little agitated. Speaking at a normal pace, she explained that her depressive symptoms had begun 2 years earlier in the setting of initiating divorce proceedings from her fourth husband. She described **poor mood, incapacitating worry about her future, and poor concentration**. These symptoms progressed to **anhedonia, decreased energy, hypersomnia with interrupted sleep, passive suicidal ideation, and increased appetite with carbohydrate craving**. She stopped going to work as an event planner and began spending most of the day in bed.\n\nMs. Owens initially sought treatment from a homeopath, who prescribed a variety of remedies that were not helpful. She eventually saw her internist, who prescribed **alprazolam 0.25 mg three times a day as needed**. This medication reduced her worry but had little effect on her mood. Her internist then initiated **sertraline 50 mg/day, increasing the dosage (as tolerated) to 200 mg/day**. Over the ensuing 2 months, Ms.Owens's sleep improved and she no longer experienced suicidal thoughts. However, she became **more anxious, irritable, agitated, and energized and noted that her thoughts moved rapidly**. She denied impulsivity and psychotic symptoms.\n\nMs. Owens had a long-standing history of similar depressive episodes. The first such episode occurred during college, lasted for several months, and was untreated.\n\nWhen specifically asked, she described multiple periods in her life when she had **moderately elevated mood, rapid thoughts, and increased energy**. It seemed that many important life accomplishments occurred during these periods. For instance, as a young, recently divorced unemployed single mother, she agreed to throw a bridal shower for her best friend. She pored over bridal and craft magazines, determined to create a fabulous party on a shoestring budget. She became totally engrossed in the project, seeming to have abundant energy and ideas. The shower was a huge success and launched Ms.Owens's career as a party planner. She hid her mood swings from her clients and colleagues, leveraging her elevated mood states to project a high-energy face, but then would retreat and avoid work when her mood became low. She also became more irritable during these high-energy episodes, and she believed that each of her marriages both began and ended because of her tendency to get emotional when she was in these elevated mood states. Although these periods could last for many weeks, she did not experience changes in sleep, engage in risky behaviors, speak quickly, or become grandiose, and she saw nothing problematic about them.\n\nMs. Owens also reported that she drank heavily when she was in her 40s but rarely did so now. She denied prior suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. Her mother had been treated for depression with sertraline, and her brother was treated with lithium for bipolar disorder.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Ms. Owens's symptoms align with a diagnosis of **Bipolar I Disorder**.  Her history includes periods of major depressive episodes with classic symptoms like anhedonia and suicidal ideation, as well as periods of elevated mood with increased energy, rapid thoughts, and irritability that meet criteria for manic episodes."

Wood, M.D.**\n\n**Wyatt was a 12-year-old-boy** referred by his psychiatrist to an adolescent partial hospitalization program because of repeated conflicts that have frightened both classmates and family members.\n\n**According to his parents, Wyatt was generally moody and irritable,** with frequent episodes of being a raging monster. It had become almost impossible to set limits. Most recently, Wyatt had smashed a closet door to gain access to a video game that had been withheld to encourage him to do homework. At school, Wyatt was noted to have a hair-trigger temper, and he had recently been suspended for punching another boy in the face after losing a chess match.\n\n**Wyatt had been an extremely active young boy,** running all the time. He was also a sensitive kid who constantly worried that things might go wrong. His tolerance for frustration had been less than that of his peers, and his parents quit taking him shopping because he would predictably become distraught whenever they did not buy him whatever toys he wanted.\n\n**Grade school reports indicated fidgetiness, wandering attention, and impulsivity.** When Wyatt was 10 years old, a child psychiatrist diagnosed him as having attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), combined type. Wyatt was referred to a behavioral therapist and started taking methylphenidate, which led to an improvement in his symptoms. However, by fourth grade, his moodiness became more pronounced and persistent. He was generally surly, complaining that life was unfair. Wyatt and his parents began their daily limit-setting battles at breakfast while he delayed getting ready for school, and then-by evening-continued their arguments about homework, videogames, and bedtime. These arguments often included Wyatt screaming and throwing nearby objects. By the time he reached sixth grade, his parents were tired and his siblings avoided him.\n\n**According to Wyatt's parents, he had no problems with appetite,** and although they fought about when he would go to bed, he did not appear to have a sleep disturbance. He appeared to find pleasure in his usual activities, maintained good energy, and had no history of elation, grandiosity, or decreased need for sleep lasting more than a day.\n\n**Although they described him as moody, isolated, and lonely, his parents did not see him as depressed.** They denied any history of hallucinations, abuse, trauma, suicidality, homicidality, a wish to self-harm, or any premeditated wish to harm others. He and his parents denied he had ever used alcohol or drugs. His medical history was unremarkable. His family history was notable for anxiety and depression in the father, alcoholism in the paternal grandparents, and possible untreated ADHD in the mother.\n\n**On interview, Wyatt was mildly anxious yet easy to engage.** His body twisted back and forth as he sat in the chair. In reviewing his temper outbursts and physical aggression, Wyatt said, \"It's like I can't help myself. I don't mean to do these things. But when I get mad, I don't think about any of that. It's like my mind goes blank.\" When asked how he felt about his outbursts, Wyatt looked very sad and said earnestly, \"I hate when I'm that way.\" If he could change three things in his life, Wyatt replied, \"I would have more friends, I would do better in school, and I would stop getting mad so much.\"",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Wyatt's symptoms suggest he may have  **Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)** or **Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED)**. His frequent temper outbursts, difficulty controlling his impulses, and pattern of arguing with authority figures are consistent with these diagnoses. Further evaluation by a mental health professional is needed for a definitive diagnosis."

She was referred by her breastfeeding nurse, who was concerned about the patient's **depressed mood, flat affect, and fatigue**.\n\nMs. Perez said she had been **worried and unenthusiastic** since finding out she was pregnant. She and her husband planned to wait a few years before having another child, and her husband made it clear that he would have preferred that she terminate the pregnancy, an option she would not consider because of her religion. He had also been upset that she was too tired to do paid work outside of the home during her pregnancy. She became **increasingly dysphoric, hopeless, and overwhelmed** after the delivery.\n\n**Breastfeeding was not going well**, and she began to believe her baby was rejecting her by refusing her breast, spitting up her milk, and crying. Her baby became very colicky, so she felt forced to hold him most of the day. She wondered whether she deserved this difficulty because she had not wanted the pregnancy.\n\nHer husband was gone much of the time for work, and she found it **very difficult to take care of the new baby and her lively and demanding 16-month-old daughter**. Over the past several weeks she slept little, felt constantly tired, cried often, and worried about how she was going to get through the day. Her mother-in-law had just arrived to help her care for the children, and she thought Ms. Perez just had the typical postpartum blues that result from hormones being out of whack.\n\nMs. Perez was an English-speaking Hispanic woman who had worked in a coffee shop until midway through her first pregnancy, almost 2 years earlier. She was raised in a supportive home by her parents and has a large extended family. She moved to a different region of the country when her husband was transferred for work, and she had no relatives nearby. Although no one in her family had seen a psychiatrist, several family members appeared to have been depressed. She had **no prior psychiatric history or treatment**. She denied illicit drug or alcohol use. She had smoked for several years but stopped when she was pregnant with her first child. Ms. Perez had a history of asthma.\n\nAside from a multivitamin with iron, she took no medications.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Perez was a casually dressed, cooperative young woman. She made some eye contact, but her eyes tended to drop to the floor when she spoke. Her speech was fluent but slow, with **increased latency** when answering questions. The tone of her speech was flat. She endorsed **low mood**, and her affect was constricted. She denied thoughts of suicide and homicide. She also denied any hallucinations and delusions, although she had considered whether the current situation was punishment for not wanting the child. She was **fully oriented** and could register three objects but only recalled one after 5 minutes. Her intelligence was average. Her insight and judgment were fair to good.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Yvonne Perez's symptoms align with  **F43.21 (Recurrent depressive disorder, single episode)** from the ICD-11.

The young man, who had struggled with major depressive disorder and substance use disorder, had been found surrounded by several emptied pill bottles and an incoherent suicide note.\n\n**Mr. Quinn** had been very close to his troubled son, and he immediately felt crushed, like his life had lost its meaning. In the ensuing 2 weeks, he had constant images of his son and was obsessed with how he might have prevented the substance abuse and suicide. He worried that he had been a bad father and that he had spent too much time on his own career and too little time with his son. He felt constantly sad, withdrew from his usual social life, and was unable to concentrate on his work. Although he had never previously drunk more than a few glasses of wine per week, he increased his alcohol intake to half a bottle of wine each night. At that time, his psychiatrist told him that he was struggling with grief and that such a reaction was normal. They agreed to meet for support and to assess the ongoing clinical situation.\n\n**Mr. Quinn** returned to see his psychiatrist weekly. By the sixth week after the suicide, his symptoms had worsened. Instead of thinking about what he might have done differently, he became preoccupied that he should have been the one to die, not his young son. He continued to have trouble falling asleep, but he also tended to awake at 4:30 a.m. and just stare at the ceiling, feeling overwhelmed with fatigue, sadness, and feelings of worthlessness. These symptoms improved during the day, but he also felt a persistent and uncharacteristic loss of self-confidence, sexual interest, and enthusiasm. He asked his psychiatrist whether he still had normal grief or had major depressive disorder.\n\n**Mr. Quinn** had a history of two prior major depressive episodes that improved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, but no significant depressive episodes since his 30s. He denied a history of alcohol or substance use disorders. Both of his parents had been depressive but without treatment. No one in the family had previously committed suicide.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on Mr. Quinn's symptoms following his son's suicide,  a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (F32) is appropriate.

During that time, she reported **depression every day for most of the day**. Symptoms had been worsening for months. She had lost 9 lb (current weight 105 lb) without dieting because she did not feel like eating. She had trouble falling asleep almost every night and woke at 3:00 a.m. several mornings per week (she normally woke at 6:30 a.m.).

She was particularly upset about marital conflict and an uncharacteristic irritability with her mother-in-law.\n\n**Ms. Smith said she had begun to wake before dawn, feeling down and tearful. She had difficulty getting out of bed and completing her usual household activities. At times, she felt guilty for not being her usual self. At other times, she became easily irritated with her husband and impatient with her mother-in-law for minor transgressions.** She relied on her mother-in-law for assistance with her children, but recently her mother-in-law appeared to be less available. Ms. Smith worries that she has become a burden to her mother-in-law. Her related guilt, in combination with her insomnia and fatigue, have made it very difficult for Ms. Smith to get her children to school on time. In the past few months, she had lost 13 pounds without dieting. She denied current suicidal ideation, saying she would never do something like that, but acknowledged having thought that she should just give up and that she would be better off dead. She decided to make an appointment after she attended her good friend's wedding and found she did not enjoy any of it.\n\n**Two months previously, Ms. Smith had seen a psychiatrist for several weeks and received fluoxetine. She reluctantly gave it a try, discontinuing it quickly because it made her feel even more tired. She had also dropped out of therapy, indicating that the psychiatrist did not seem to understand her.**\n\nMs. Smith lived with her husband of 13 years and two school-age children. Her husband's parents lived next door. She said her marriage was good, although her husband suggested she go see someone so that she would not be pacing and yelling at everyone all the time. While historically sociable, she now rarely talked to her own mother and sisters, much less her friends. Previously a regular churchgoer, she had quit attending because she felt her faith was weak. Her pastor had always been supportive, but she had not contacted him with her problems because he wouldn't want to hear about these kinds of issues.\n\n**Ms. Smith described herself as having been an outgoing, friendly child. She grew up with her parents and three siblings. She recalled feeling quite upset at age 10-11 when her parents divorced and her mom remarried. Because of fights with other kids at school, she met with a school counselor with whom she felt a bond. Unlike the psychiatrist she had recently consulted, Ms. Smith felt the counselor did not get into my business and helped her recover. She said she became quieter as she entered junior high school, with fewer friends and little interest in studying. She married her husband at age 20 and worked in retail sales until the birth of their first child when she was 23 years old.**\n\nMs. Smith had not used alcohol since her first pregnancy, and she denied any use of illicit substances. She also denied past and current use of prescribed medications, other than the brief trial of the antidepressant medication.

Somewhat embarrassed, she told the consulting psychiatrist that she had been feeling low for years and that hearing criticism of her work had been just too much.\n\n**A native of western Canada**, Ms. Taylor came to the United States to pursue graduate studies in chemistry. She left graduate school before completing her doctorate and began work as a laboratory technician. She reported feeling frustrated with her job, which she saw as a dead end, yet feared that she lacked the talent to find more satisfying work. As a result, she struggled with guilty feelings that she hadn't done much with her life.\n\n**Despite her troubles at work**, Ms. Taylor felt that she could concentrate without difficulty. She denied ever having active suicidal thoughts, yet sometimes wondered, What is the point of life? When asked, she reported that she occasionally had trouble falling asleep. However, she denied any change in her weight or appetite. Although she occasionally would go out with coworkers, she said that she felt shy and awkward in social situations unless she knew the people well. She did enjoy jogging and the outdoors.

She had yelled at him and then, out of the blue, ended the relationship. She felt despondent afterward, guilty and self-critical. When she called him to make up, he had refused, saying he was tired of her PMS [premenstrual syndrome] explosions. She had then cut herself superficially on her left forearm, which she had found to be a reliable method to reduce anxiety since she was a young teenager.\n\nShe said these mood swings came out of the blue every month and that they featured tension, argumentativeness, anxiety, sadness, and regret. Sometimes she yelled at her boyfriend, but she also got upset with friends, work, and her family. During the week in which she was Mr. Hyde, she avoided socializing or talking on the phone; she wouldn't be her usual fun self, she said, and would alienate her friends. She was able to work when she felt miserable, but she did have relatively poor energy and concentration. She was also edgy and self-pitying and regretful that she had chosen to waste her youth working so hard for an uncaring financial institution.\n\nWhen she was feeling desperate, she would be determined to seek treatment. Soon after the onset of her period, however, she would improve dramatically, return to her old self, and not find the time to see a psychiatrist. During the several weeks after her period, she said she felt fine, terrific, the usual.\n\nShe said the mood swings always started 7-10 days before the start of her menstrual period, like terrible PMS. Her periods were regular. She had premenstrual breast tenderness, bloating, increased appetite, and weight gain. Almost as soon as her period began, she felt suddenly good. She denied alcohol or illicit substance use and had no history of psychotic, manic, or obsessional symptoms. She denied any suicidal thoughts and any prior suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. She denied allergies and medical problems. She took one medication, her birth control pill. Her family history was pertinent for a mother with possible depression. Ms. Wang was born in Taiwan and came to the United States at age 14 to attend boarding school. After graduating from an elite business school, she had moved in with her older sister.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Wang was a fashionably dressed East Asian woman wearing tasteful jewelry and carrying a designer bag. Her hair was slightly askew. She maintained good eye contact and was pleasant and cooperative throughout the interview. Her speech was normal in rate, rhythm, and volume. She described her mood as generally good, and her affect was full, reactive, and mildly irritable. Her thought process was linear, and she showed no evidence of delusions, obsessions, or hallucinations. She denied suicidal and homicidal ideation. Her insight, judgment, and impulse control were intact, although she noted a history of perimenstrual impairment in these areas.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on her symptoms, Emma Wang most likely has Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD).  Her mood swings, irritability, and self-criticism that start a week before her period and improve after menstruation align with PMDD criteria.  She also reports physical symptoms like breast tenderness, bloating, and appetite changes typical of premenstrual syndrome."

        "clinical_case": "**Edward V. Nunes, M.D.**\n\n**Frank Young**, a 40-year-old business executive, was brought for a psychiatric consultation by his wife. While Mr. Young sat quietly beside her, she reported that a change had come over him during the last 6 months. He was either **quiet and withdrawn or uncharacteristically irritable**. He had begun to drink alcohol to excess in social situations, sometimes embarrassing her. He often came home late, or not at all, claiming to have been at the office. When away from home, he rarely answered phone calls and text messages. She wondered if he was having an affair. Mr. Young denied seeing anyone else and indicated he had just been having a hard time.\n\nAfter his wife left the psychiatrist's office, Mr. Young reported a great deal of stress at work over the last year as he tried to deal with industry-wide setbacks and personal financial losses. He said he felt **down and depressed most of the time**. He reported **difficulty sleeping most nights, loss of interest in his wife and children, low energy, and feelings of failure and self-criticism**. He had frequent thoughts of wanting to be dead and of suicide, but he denied any suicidal intent or plans.\n\nWhen asked about the alcohol, he acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for at least 6 months. When asked about other substances, he asked about therapeutic confidentiality and then acknowledged that he had been using **cocaine several times per week for about 9 months**. He kept his cocaine use from his wife because he knew she would be judgmental. In the beginning, cocaine put him in a reliably positive, optimistic mood, and he found that he could more successfully churn through large volumes of otherwise tedious and discouraging work. Although his work required some socializing in the evening, he also began to regularly go to bars in the evening just so that he would have a place to comfortably combine cocaine with alcohol. He craved the high from cocaine, went out of his way to obtain it, and spent a lot of time getting high that he would previously have been spending with his family.\n\nWhen asked to clarify the sequence of work stress, cocaine use, and depression symptoms, he reported that he had felt worried and discouraged about work for a year, but the feelings of **depression, loss of interest, irritability, insomnia, and low self-esteem** had not begun until about 6 months earlier, 3 months after he had begun to use cocaine regularly. He experienced those depressive symptoms most of the day every day, whether or not he had taken cocaine within the last several days.\n\nMr. Young denied any previous episodes of depression, other mood or anxiety disorders, or suicide attempts. He drank socially. He had experimented with cannabis and cocaine as a teenager but had never developed a pattern of regular use or impairment until the past year.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the information provided, Mr. Young's symptoms of depression, low energy, irritability, and substance use point towards a diagnosis of  **Major Depressive Disorder (F32.9)** according to the ICD-11. His cocaine use and suicidal ideation further complicate the picture and warrant careful monitoring."

        "clinical_case": "**Thomas W. Meeks, M.D.**\n\n**George Anderson**, a 73-year-old married man, was referred to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of depression after screening positive on the Geriatric Depression Scale during a neurology appointment. For most of the 2 years since his diagnosis with Parkinson's disease, Mr. Anderson had coped well and continued to engage in many of his usual activities. His wife of 49 years noted that 1-2 years before developing Parkinson's disease, Mr. Anderson had become somewhat less enthusiastic and motivated compared with his baseline personality, but not to the point of causing any concern or impairment. The only other neuropsychiatric symptom preceding his Parkinson's diagnosis was his wife's report that during the past 5 years he frequently thrashed about while asleep.\n\n**Three months prior to the referral**, however, Mr. Anderson began to decline social invitations from family and friends. He reported that he had withdrawn socially because he had lost pleasure in things that used to excite him, although he denied persistent feelings of sadness or worry. He recognized that he was not his usual self and tried, to no avail, to give himself pep talks. He had worked as a high school science teacher until retirement at age 67, and reported having learned the power of seeing the glass half full from his students. He felt frustrated that he could not snap out of it for the first time in his life but was hopeful about getting professional help. He denied wishing for death, explaining that although he was not afraid of death, he wanted to enjoy life as long as possible. He added, God does not give me more than I can handle. I can't ask for a better family, and I have had a full life.\n\n**Other new symptoms** over the prior few months included increasing fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, unintentional weight loss, and sleep-onset insomnia.\n\n**Further history** on his more chronic sleep symptoms revealed that, around 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. on most nights, Mr. Anderson began violently moving his extremities and moaning as though in distress, all while still seemingly asleep in bed. He often awakened his wife with these movements and occasionally struck her in his sleep. She sometimes used a different bedroom because of this. When he awoke from such an incident, he was coherent and briefly anxious, often reporting that he had been dreaming of swimming or running from something.\n\n**His wife took over driving** shortly after his Parkinson's disease diagnosis, but Mr. Anderson was otherwise independent in activities of daily living such as paying bills and managing his medications. His wife described him as maybe a little more forgetful over the past few years, but neither of them was concerned about this mild memory loss.\n\n**Past medical history** included prostate cancer (in remission), glaucoma, and gout. Labs from his recent neurology visit were unremarkable, including blood counts, serum chemistries, thyroid function, and vitamin B12 levels. Family psychiatric history was positive only for a granddaughter with ADHD. He denied past problematic substance use and all current substance use except two or three glasses of wine monthly. He denied any previous depressive episodes, psychiatric treatment, or psychiatric evaluations.\n\n**On mental status examination**, Mr. Anderson was pleasant, cooperative, and interpersonally engaging. Resting tremor, shuffling gait, hypophonia, and bradykinesia all were evident at mild to moderate levels. He occasionally smiled, but his affect was difficult to fully gauge because of masked facies. He reported his mood as blah. There was no evidence of psychosis.\n\n**On cognitive testing**, he had some difficulty on the Trail Making Test part B, figure copying, and word-list recall, the latter being helped by category prompts. On a standardized brief cognitive assessment, he scored 25 out of 30 points, which was in the normal range.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Anderson's symptoms suggest  a possible diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (F32). His withdrawal from social activities, loss of pleasure, fatigue, and sleep disturbances align with depressive disorder criteria.   It is important to note that a definitive diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation by a qualified healthcare professional."

        "clinical_case": "**Joseph F. Goldberg, M.D.**\n\n**Helena Bates** was a 27-year-old single administrative assistant who presented for a psychiatric evaluation and treatment for depression. She had recently begun an intensive outpatient program after a first lifetime hospitalization for an impulsive overdose following the breakup of a 2-year relationship. She said she had been feeling increasingly sad and hopeless for 1-2 months prior to the breakup. About a month before her admission, she began seeing a new psychotherapist who told her she had borderline traits and situational mood swings.\n\nDuring these 4-8 weeks, Ms. Bates's mood had been **moderately depressed** throughout the day most days, with no diurnal variation and intact mood reactivity. She had recently gained about 10 pounds from overeating comfort food and junk. She denied prominent irritability or argumentativeness. She described her self-esteem as none and had found it hard to feel motivation or to concentrate on routine tasks. By contrast, sometimes she would have bursts of nonstop thinking about her estranged boyfriend and devising ways to get him back, alternating with grieving his loss. She described times of being flooded with strategies to regain his interest (including purchasing a full-page newspaper open letter to him) and recently found herself awake until 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. journaling or calling friends in the middle of the night for support. She would then trudge through the day without fatigue after only 2-3 hours of sleep. These symptoms began prior to her hospitalization. She denied drug or alcohol misuse and self-injurious behavior. Until this particular breakup, she denied a history of particularly intense or chaotic relationships, as well as a history of suicidal thoughts or gestures. Indeed, Ms. Bates seemed horrified by her own impulsive overdose.\n\nPreviously, Ms. Bates had seen a counselor in high school for moodiness and poor grades. She became depressed in college. At that time, she began escitalopram and psychotherapy, but improved quickly and stopped both after a few weeks. While in the hospital following her suicide attempt, she started taking vilazodone and quetiapine at bedtime for sleep.\n\nMs. Bates was the youngest of three children who grew up in a middle-class suburban home. She attended public school and a state college as mostly a B student and hoped to someday go to law school. She described herself as having been a quiet, anxious child and not a troublemaker. Her older brother abused multiple substances, although Ms. Bates said she herself had never used illicit substances. Her older sister was treated for panic attacks and depression, and Ms. Bates knew of several aunts and cousins whom she thought were depressed.\n\nOn examination, Ms. Bates was a pleasant, well-related, casually but appropriately dressed, moderately overweight woman, appearing her stated age, who made good eye contact. Her speech was somewhat rapid and verbose but interruptible and nonpressured. She had no abnormal motor movements, but she gestured dramatically and with excessive animation. Her mood was depressed, and her affect was tense and dysphoric but with full range and normal responsivity. Ms. Bates's thought processes were somewhat circumstantial but generally coherent, linear, and logical. Her thought content was notable for passive thoughts that she might be better off dead, but without intent or plan; she had no delusions, hallucinations, or homicidal thoughts. Her higher integrative functioning was grossly intact, as were her insight and judgment.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on Helena Bates's symptoms of mood swings, impulsive behaviors, unstable relationships, and difficulty regulating emotions, a possible diagnosis is Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).  Her history of suicidal ideation and past treatment for depression also support this diagnosis. Her self-awareness and willingness to seek help suggest she has good insight into her condition."

        "clinical_case": "**Peter D. Kramer, M.D.**\n\n**Ian Campbell** was a 32-year-old architect who presented for psychiatric consultation because he was floundering at work. His boss had expressed concern after he failed to make progress on a simple project. When Mr. Campbell explained that he had been distracted by problems at home, his boss suggested that more seemed wrong. **Mr. Campbell called his internist, who sent him to a neurologist, who referred him for psychiatric evaluation.**\n\n**Mr. Campbell had encountered this problem, difficulty concentrating, before.** In college, after his father died of a chronic illness, Mr. Campbell had been unable to study and had taken time off. Twice at his prior job, he experienced episodes lasting months in which he had difficulty making decisions. One of these intervals followed a romantic setback.\n\n**The patient's mother and sister had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and treated successfully with medication. A maternal uncle had committed suicide.**\n\n**The current impairment's onset accompanied the breakdown of Mr. Campbell's marriage of 6 years.** Two months earlier, his wife had filed for divorce, announcing that she would live in the distant city her work had taken her to. Mr. Campbell had expected to feel relief; he said his wife had been hostile throughout the marriage. He had begun to entertain fond thoughts of a coworker. Nevertheless, he felt flat-unable to imagine a future.\n\n**Closer questioning revealed that Mr. Campbell's problems went beyond impaired cognition.** He described apathy and diminished energy. Jazz was a passion, but he no longer attended recitals-although impaired concentration probably played a role as well. Listening, the psychiatrist noted probable retardation of speech. Mr. Campbell said that his employer had mentioned that he was moving in slow motion. The problems were worse in the mornings. In the evenings, Mr. Campbell noticed a spark of energy. He put on music and reviewed reports that he had ignored during the workday.\n\n**Mr. Campbell declined to characterize himself as sad. He was pleased that the marriage was ending.** But the psychiatrist was struck by her own affect in Mr. Campbell's presence; she felt glum, pessimistic, even weepy.\n\n**She questioned Mr. Campbell at length about depressed mood, changed sleep and appetite, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and thoughts of death. None of these attributions, he said, applied. Nor had he had indicators of disorders that can be confused with depression. Between episodes of impairment, he felt and functioned well.**\n\n**The psychiatrist decided that the problem at hand was close enough to depression to warrant treatment. Factors that influenced her decision included the partial syndromal presentation, diurnal variation, periodic recurrence, lack of future orientation, and her own empathic experience.** She proposed psychotherapy centered on Mr. Campbell's decompensation in the face of loss. He insisted that he did not see the impending divorce in that light. The two agreed on brief psychotherapy supplemented by antidepressants.\n\n**Within weeks, Mr. Campbell was functioning at full capacity. During the treatment, the psychiatrist was unable to elicit evidence of depressive symptoms beyond those noted in the initial history. All the same, she was convinced that the impaired concentration was a sign and symptom of something very much like major depressive disorder.**\n",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information and ICD-11 codes, Mr. Campbell's presentation suggests  a possible diagnosis of Personality traits or coping style affecting disorders or diseases classified elsewhere (6E40.2). His difficulty concentrating could be a result of his personality traits or coping mechanisms adversely affecting his ability to function at work."

Lim, M.D.**\n\n**Ka Fang**, a 59-year-old widowed Hmong woman, was referred to a mental health care clinic after she recurrently complained to her primary care physician of **fatigue, chronic back pain, and insomnia**. Over the preceding 11 months, the internist had prescribed **clonazepam for sleep and Vicodin (hydrocodone/acetaminophen) for pain**. Her sleep had improved and her pain decreased, but she continued to feel tired all day. At that point, the internist referred her for the psychiatric evaluation.\n\nMs. Fang had immigrated to the United States from Thailand a decade earlier. Natives of Laos, she and her family had spent almost two decades in a Thai refugee camp following the Vietnam War. Her family had resettled in the Sacramento area with the assistance of a local church group.\n\nWhen questioned through a Hmong interpreter, Ms. Fang denied depressed mood. When asked if she enjoyed things, she said that she felt privileged to be in America and had no right to complain. She said she felt she was not doing enough to help her family. She was embarrassed by her fatigue because she did not do anything all day. She denied any intention to harm herself.\n\nShe said she was very proud of all her children, especially her son, who had been an excellent student in Thailand and spoke good English. Nevertheless, her son, his wife, and their two young children followed many of the cultural practices that they had followed in Laos and Thailand, and often prepared Hmong food for dinner. He and his wife had bought a small farm outside Sacramento and were doing well, cultivating Asian vegetables. Her son had employed her two daughters on the farm until both had moved back to live in the Hmong community in Sacramento.\n\nMs. Fang indicated that the transition to California had gone better than she had expected. The biggest disappointments for her had been her husband's unexpected death from a heart attack 1 year earlier and the fact that most of her extended family had remained in Thailand.\n\nOn mental status examination, the patient was short and heavyset. She wore a floral short-sleeve blouse, black polyester slacks, black flip-flops, and no makeup. She had white strings tied around her wrists. Her eyes were generally downcast, but she seemed alert. She appeared sad and constricted but denied feeling depressed. Her speech was slow and careful. She denied all hallucinations, suicidality, and homicidality. Cognitive testing revealed normal attention and concentration. She had little formal education and appeared to be functionally illiterate. Her insight into her illness appeared limited.\n\nWhen asked about the strings around her wrists, Ms. Fang explained that she had recently sought out a Hmong shaman, who had organized several soul-calling ceremonies to reunite with distant relatives.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on Ms. Fang's persistent fatigue,  low energy, and feelings of inadequacy despite improved sleep and pain management, a diagnosis of Bipolar type II disorder, currently in partial remission, most recent episode depressive (6A61.8) is likely. Her cultural background and recent grief may also contribute to her symptoms."

Afterward, he became scared that he might have a hidden disease. His parents reported three panic attacks in the prior month, marked by anxiety, dizziness, sweats, and shortness of breath. About that same time, Logan began to complain of frequent headaches and stomachaches. Logan's own theory was that his bodily aches were caused by his fears about being ill and about his parents going away, but the pain was still uncomfortable. He insisted he was not scared about having more panic attacks but was petrified about being left sick and alone. These illness fears developed several times a week, usually when Logan was in bed, when he felt something in his body, or when he heard about diseases.\n\n**Logan had begun to suffer from anxieties as a young child.** Kindergarten was notable for intense separation difficulties. He was briefly bullied in third grade, which led to his first panic attacks and worsening anxiety. According to his parents, there always seemed to be a new anxiety. These included fear of the toilet, the dark, sleeping alone, being alone, and being pestered.\n\n**Logan's most persistent fear revolved around his parents' safety.** He was generally fine when both were at work or at home, but when they were in transit, or anywhere else, he was generally afraid that they would die in an accident. When the parents were late from work or when they tried to go out together or on an errand without him, Logan became frantic, calling and texting incessantly. Logan was predominantly concerned about his mother's safety, and she had gradually reduced her solo activities to a minimum. As she said, it felt like he would like to follow me into the toilet. Logan was less demanding toward his father, who believed his wife had been too soft and overprotective.\n\n**Logan and his family underwent several months of psychotherapy when Logan was age 10.** The father said therapy helped his wife become less overprotective, and Logan's anxiety seemed to improve. Logan's mother agreed with this assessment, although she said she was not sure what she was supposed to do when her son was panicking whenever she tried to leave the house or whenever he worried about getting a disease.\n\nLogan's developmental history was otherwise unremarkable. His grades were generally good. His teachers agreed that he was quiet but had several friends and collaborated well with other children. He was quick, however, to negatively interpret the intentions of other children. For example, he tended to be very sensitive to any indication that he was being picked on.\n\n**Logan's family history was pertinent for panic disorder, agoraphobia, and social anxiety disorder in the mother.** The maternal grandmother was described as at least as anxious as Logan's mother. The father denied psychiatric illness in his family.\n\n**On examination, Logan was a friendly, articulate boy who was cooperative and goal directed.** He was generally in a good mood but cried when talking about his fears of dying and getting sick. He denied suicidality and hopelessness but indicated he was desperate to get over his problems before starting high school. His cognition was good. His insight and judgment appeared intact except as related to his anxiety issues.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on Logan's presentation of persistent fears about illness and parental safety, coupled with his history of anxiety and panic attacks, a possible diagnosis could be  Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The ICD-11 code for GAD is 6F20. It's important to note that this is just a potential diagnosis based on the provided information and further evaluation by a qualified mental health professional is necessary for a definitive diagnosis."

In the prior 2 months, she had presented to the emergency room four times for acute complaints of **palpitations, shortness of breath, sweats, trembling, and the fear that she was about to die**. Each of these events had a rapid onset. The symptoms peaked within minutes, leaving her scared, exhausted, and fully convinced that she had just experienced a heart attack. Medical evaluations done right after these episodes yielded normal physical exam findings, vital signs, lab results, toxicology screens, and electrocardiograms.\n\nThe patient reported a total of five such attacks in the prior 3 months, with the panic occurring at work, at home, and while driving a car. She had developed a **persistent fear of having other attacks**, which led her to take many days off work and to avoid exercise, driving, and coffee. Her sleep quality declined, as did her mood. She avoided social relationships. She did not accept the reassurance offered to her by friends and physicians, believing that the medical workups were negative because they were performed after the resolution of the symptoms. She continued to suspect that something was wrong with her heart and that without an accurate diagnosis, she was going to die. When she had a panic attack while asleep in the middle of the night, she finally agreed to see a psychiatrist.\n\nMs. Greco denied a history of previous psychiatric disorders except for a history of anxiety during childhood that had been diagnosed as a school phobia.\n\nThe patient's mother had committed suicide by overdose 4 years earlier in the context of recurrent major depressive disorder. At the time of the evaluation, the patient was living with her father and two younger siblings. The patient had graduated from high school, was working as a telephone operator, and was not dating anyone. Her family and social histories were otherwise noncontributory.\n\nOn examination, the patient was an **anxious-appearing, cooperative, coherent young woman**. She denied depression but did appear worried and was preoccupied with ideas of having heart disease. She denied psychotic symptoms, confusion, and all suicidality. Her cognition was intact, insight was limited, and judgment was fair.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Ms. Greco's symptoms align with  **Panic Disorder (F41.0)** as per ICD-11. Her recurrent panic attacks, fear of future attacks, and avoidance behaviors due to anxiety are consistent with this diagnosis.   The absence of other specified delusional beliefs or body dysmorphic features further supports this conclusion."

Milrod, M.D.**\n\n**Nadine was a 15-year-old girl whose mother brought her for a psychiatric evaluation to help with her long-standing shyness.**\n\nAlthough Nadine was initially reluctant to say much about herself, she said she felt constantly tense. She added that the anxiety had been really bad for several years and was often accompanied by episodes of dizziness and crying. She was generally unable to speak in any situation outside of her home or school classes. She refused to leave her house alone for fear of being forced to interact with someone. She was especially anxious around other teenagers, but she had also become too nervous to speak to adult neighbors she had known for years. She said it felt impossible to walk into a restaurant and order from a stranger at the counter for fear of being humiliated. She also felt constantly on her guard, needing to avoid the possibility of getting attacked, a strategy that really only worked when she was alone in her home.\n\n**Nadine tried to conceal her crippling anxiety from her parents, typically telling them that she just didn't feel like going out.** Feeling trapped and incompetent, Nadine said she contemplated suicide all the time. In the month before her mother finally brought her in for a psychiatric evaluation, Nadine had begun to cut herself on her thighs to feel pain and relieve stress. No one in the family was aware of this development.\n\n**Nadine had always been shy and had been teased at recess since she started kindergarten.** The teasing had escalated to outright bullying by the time she was in seventh grade. The bullying took on a cultural/racially motivated undertone; Nadine and her family were of a different ethnicity than the vast majority of her schoolmates. For 2 years, day after difficult day, Nadine's peers turned on her like a snarling wolf pack, calling her stupid, ugly, and crazy. Not infrequently, one of them would stare at her and tell her she would be better off committing suicide. One girl (the ringleader, as well as a former elementary school chum) hit Nadine on one occasion, giving her a black eye. Nadine did not fight back. This event was witnessed by an adult neighbor, who told Nadine's mother. When Nadine's mother asked her about the incident, Nadine denied it, saying she had fallen on the street. She did, however, mention to her mother in passing that she wanted to switch schools, but her delivery was so offhand that at the time, her mother casually advised against the switch. Nadine suffered on, sobbing herself to sleep most nights and wishing that she would not wake up.\n\n**Full of hope and ideas of escape from the bullies and their narrowness, Nadine transferred to a specialty arts high school for ninth grade.** Although the bullying ceased, her anxiety symptoms paradoxically worsened. She felt even more unable to venture into public spaces and felt increasingly embarrassed by her inability to develop the sort of independence typical of a 15-year-old. She said she had begun to spend whole weekends trapped in her home and had become scared to even read by herself in the local park.\n\n**Nadine's social anxiety had evolved into true agoraphobia.** She had nightly nightmares about the bullies in her old school. Her preoccupation with suicide grew.\n\n**Her parents had thought she would outgrow being shy and sought psychiatric help for her only after a teacher remarked that her anxiety and social isolation were keeping her from making the sort of grades and doing the sort of extracurricular activities that were necessary to get into a good college.**\n\n**Nadine described her mother as loud, excitable, aggressive, and a little frightening.** Her father was a successful tax attorney who worked long hours. Nadine described him as shy in social situations (\"He's more like me\"). Nadine said she and her father sometimes joked that the goal of any evening was to avoid tipping the mother into a rage. Nadine added that she never wanted to be anything like her mother.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on Nadine's symptoms of crippling anxiety, social isolation, and self-harm, a possible diagnosis according to the ICD-11 could be  **Mental disorder affecting disorders or diseases classified elsewhere (6E40.0)**.

He reported that he usually feels fine except when he is confronted with his **inability to travel by airplane**. His only daughter had delivered a baby in the prior year, and although he desperately wanted to meet his first granddaughter, he felt unable to fly across the Atlantic Ocean to where his daughter lived.\n\nThe patient's anxiety about flying had begun 3 years earlier when he was on an airplane that landed during an ice storm. He had last flown a year earlier but had cried during both takeoff and landing; he had then found himself unable to return from that trip by airplane and instead took a train from Rome to Amsterdam. He had gone with his wife to an airport one additional time, 1 year prior to the evaluation, to fly to his daughter's wedding in the United States. Despite having drunk a significant amount of alcohol, Mr. Hendricks felt unable to board the airplane. After that failed effort, he tended to feel **intense anxiety** when he even considered the possibility of flying. Anxiety about business trips had led him to decline a promotion as well as an external job offer. Mr. Hendricks sees himself as a family man and feels terrible that he failed to attend his daughter's wedding and has not yet been able to meet his granddaughter.\n\nAside from guilt and regret related to his inability to fly, Mr. Hendricks denied other symptoms of depression and anxiety.

When specifically asked, he reported that as a child, he had been petrified that he might get attacked by a wild animal. This fear had led him to refuse to go on family camping trips or even on long hikes in the country. As an adult, he said that he had no worries about being attacked by wild animals because he lived in a large city and took vacations by train to other large urban areas.",

She had never before seen a psychiatrist.\n\n**Ms. Isaac** had lived with her longtime boyfriend until 8 months earlier, at which time he had abruptly ended the relationship to date a younger woman. Soon thereafter, Ms. Isaac began to agonize about routine tasks and the possibility of making mistakes at work. She felt uncharacteristically tense and fatigued. She had difficulty focusing. She also started to worry excessively about money and, to economize, she moved into a cheaper apartment in a less desirable neighborhood. She repeatedly sought reassurance from her office mates and her mother. No one seemed able to help, and she worried about being too much of a burden.\n\nDuring the 3 months prior to the evaluation, **Ms. Isaac** began to avoid going out at night, fearing that something bad would happen and she would be unable to summon help. More recently, she avoided going out in the daytime as well. She also felt exposed and vulnerable walking to the grocery store three blocks away, so she avoided shopping.\n\nAfter describing that she had figured out how to get her food delivered, she added, \"It's ridiculous. I honestly feel something terrible is going to happen in one of the aisles and no one will help me, so I won't even go in.\" When in her apartment, she could often relax and enjoy a good book or movie.\n\n**Ms. Isaac** said she had always been a little nervous. Through much of kindergarten, she had cried inconsolably when her mother tried to drop her off. She reported seeing a counselor at age 10, during her parents' divorce, because \"my mother thought I was too clingy.\" She added that she had never liked being alone, having had boyfriends constantly (occasionally overlapping) since age 16. She explained, \"I hated being single, and I was always pretty, so I was never single for very long.\" Nevertheless, until the recent breakup, she said she had always thought of herself as fine. She had been successful at work, jogged daily, maintained a solid network of friends, and had no real complaints.\n\nOn initial interview, **Ms. Isaac** said she had been sad for a few weeks after her boyfriend left, but denied ever having felt worthless, guilty, hopeless, anhedonic, or suicidal. She said her weight was unchanged and her sleep was fine. The patient denied psychomotor changes. She did describe significant anxiety, with a Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score of 18, indicating severe anxiety.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Peggy Isaac's symptoms align with Generalized Anxiety Disorder rather than any of the listed ICD-11 diagnoses. Her excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, and difficulty concentrating point towards an anxiety disorder."

        "clinical_case": "**Andrea DiMartini, M.D.**\n**Catherine Crone, M.D.**\n\nA psychiatric transplant liaison service was called to evaluate **Robert Jennings, a 50-year-old married white man**, for a liver transplant in the context of an alcohol use disorder, advanced cirrhosis, and no other prior psychiatric history. Several weeks earlier, he had been hospitalized with acute alcohol-associated hepatitis and diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. **Prednisolone 40 mg/day** was prescribed for treatment of the hepatitis. Prior to that hospitalization, he had been unaware that his alcohol consumption was seriously damaging his health and was shocked to learn that he would eventually require a liver transplant. Upon discharge, he began an addiction treatment program that was mandatory for him to be listed for possible transplantation.\n\nOutpatient psychiatric consultation was requested by the transplant team after the patient's family expressed concern that he had recently become **increasingly irritable and anxious** and seemed to be having difficulty coping with the requirements for transplantation. Mr. Jennings's primary care physician had recently prescribed **alprazolam 0.5 mg as needed for his anxiety**. This was initially helpful, but after several days his family noticed he seemed more irritable, lethargic, and forgetful.\n\nWhen interviewed, the patient said that he had been tired for months prior to the diagnosis and that the fatigue had hampered his ability to work (his job required making deliveries for a shipping firm). Although the diagnosis had been a shock, he said he had left the hospital feeling great, better than I'd felt in years. For about a week after discharge, he described having **enhanced energy and a sense of well-being**, but he then began to feel anxious and restless. He slept poorly, unable to concentrate, and worried constantly about his health, finances, and family. He became less engaged with his family and stopped watching movies, normally his favorite pastime.\n\nHe denied having nightmares, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, or racing thoughts. He also denied low mood, tearfulness, appetite changes, anhedonia, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidality. He reported that he had started drinking daily 10 years earlier, stating that he enjoyed the taste of beer and liked socializing with friends after work. He developed tolerance to alcohol, needing to consume six to eight drinks per night to achieve the same effect. He described some withdrawal symptoms in the morning but did not drink during work hours; he underwent random testing due to his job as a truck driver. He did miss some family activities, preferring to drink, and this had been a source of marital conflict. He admitted feeling guilty about his alcohol use and its impact on him and his family. He denied using any alcohol since his hospitalization. He admitted to anger over having to undergo addiction counseling and had argued with the transplant team about this requirement. He denied having been an anxious person and considered himself able to handle most of life's challenges without being overwhelmed.\n\nHis family confirmed his description of himself and viewed his recent behavior as uncharacteristic.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Jennings was a thin, jaundiced, tired-appearing man. His gait was normal, but he was fidgety while seated. He maintained eye contact and responded appropriately, although he repeatedly made comments like, Something isn't right and It's not all in my head. His affect was anxious and irritable, and his speech was terse. He appeared distracted but denied confusion and disorientation. He had no delusions or hallucinations. His thoughts were logical and coherent, without disorganization, and there was no latency to his responses. He scored **26 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment**, missing points for recall and serial 7s. He scored in the normal range for Trail Making Test A and B but asked to have the instructions repeated for Trails B.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the information provided, Robert Jennings's symptoms point towards  anxiety due to his recent diagnosis and treatment.  He exhibits irritability, restlessness, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and excessive worrying. His history of alcohol use disorder complicates the picture, as withdrawal symptoms can also contribute to these issues."

He had been struggling with depressive symptoms for years and had tried fluoxetine, citalopram, and supportive psychotherapy, with minor improvement. He worked full-time but engaged in very few activities outside of work.\n\nWhen asked how he felt, **Mr. King said that his mood was low, he was unable to enjoy things, and he had insomnia, feelings of hopelessness, low energy, and difficulty concentrating and making decisions.** He denied current suicidality but added that a few years earlier, he had taken a full bottle of medication with the intent to kill himself. He reported that he had done this during a time that he was abusing alcohol. He denied current alcohol or illicit substance use.\n\nWhen asked about anxiety, **Mr. King said he was worried about contracting diseases such as HIV.** Aware of an unusually strong disinfectant smell, the interviewer asked the patient if he had any particular cleaning behaviors related to the HIV concerns. Mr. King paused and clarified that he avoided touching practically anything outside of his home.\n\nWhen further encouraged, **Mr. King said that if he even came close to things that he considered potentially contaminated, he had to wash his hands incessantly with household bleach.** He described that he felt like something was still there in his hands and he had to wash his hands until it felt that he had finally done it right.\n\n**On average, Mr. King washed his hands up to 30 times a day, spending hours on this routine.** Physical contact was particularly difficult. Shopping for groceries and taking public transportation were a big problem, and he had almost given up trying to socialize or engage in romantic relationships. These behaviors had only intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, though a co-worker liked to joke that Mr. King had been cleaning and social distancing for years before it became fashionable.\n\nWhen asked if he had other worries, **Mr. King replied that he had intrusive images of hitting someone, fears that he would say things that might be offensive or inaccurate, and concerns about disturbing his neighbors.** To counteract the anxiety produced by these images and thoughts, he constantly replayed prior conversations in his mind, kept diaries to record what he said, and often apologized for fear he might have sounded offensive. When he showered, he made sure that the water in the tub only reached a certain level for fear that if he were not attentive, he would flood his neighbors.\n\n**Mr. King used gloves at work and performed well. He had no medical problems. He spent most of his free time at home.** Although he enjoyed the company of others, the fear of having to touch something if he was invited to a meal or to another person's home was too much for him to handle.\n\n**The examination revealed a casually dressed man who smelled strongly of bleach. He was worried and constricted but cooperative, coherent, and goal directed. He denied hallucinations and other strongly held ideas. He denied a current intention to hurt himself or others. He was cognitively intact. He recognized that his fears and urges were kinda crazy, but he felt they were out of his control.**",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. King's symptoms align with **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**.  His excessive hand washing and fear of contamination, along with intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors like replaying conversations, are characteristic of this disorder. The ICD-11 code for OCD is 6B20."

Phillips, M.D.**\n\n**Trevor Lewis**, a 32-year-old single man living with his parents, was brought to his psychiatric consultation by his mother. She noted that since adolescence, her son had been concerned with germs, which led to long-standing hand-washing and showering rituals. During the prior 6 months, his symptoms had markedly worsened. He had become preoccupied with being infected by COVID-19 and spent the day cleaning not only his body but all of his clothing and linen. He had begun to insist that the family also wash their clothing and linen regularly, and that they keep the windows shut all the time. He allowed no visitors to their home. When the parents were occasionally exposed to other people by going outside, he insisted that they wear their masks in his presence for the ensuing 48 hours. The resulting conflicts had led to the current consultation.\n\n**Mr. Lewis** had in the past received a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and cognitive- behavioral therapy for his symptoms. These had had some positive effects, and he had been able to complete high school successfully. Nevertheless, his symptoms had prevented him from completing college or working outside the home; he had long felt that his home was relatively germ-free in comparison to the outside world. However, over the past 6 months, he had increasingly indicated that home, too, was contaminated, including with COVID-19.\n\nAt the time of presentation, **Mr. Lewis** had no other obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms such as sexual, religious, or other obsessions; appearance or acquisition preoccupations; or body-focused repetitive behaviors. However, in the past he had also experienced obsessions relating to fears of harming himself or others, together with associated checking compulsions (e.g., checking that the stove was switched off). He had a childhood history of motor tics. During high school, he found that marijuana reduced his anxiety. He denied having had access to marijuana and other psychoactive substances since leaving school.\n\n**Mr. Lewis** was interviewed over video using a telehealth system. He appeared disheveled and unkempt. He was completely convinced that COVID-19 had contaminated his home and that his washing and cleaning were necessary to stay uninfected. When challenged with information about COVID-19's mode of spread, he answered that COVID-19 might come into the home through an open window or the sweat of visitors, and his masked parents could certainly get infected by going to the grocery store. He added that his parents had tried to convince him that he was excessively worried, but he did not believe them. In fact, his worries kept returning even when he tried to think of something else.\n\nThere was no evidence of hallucinations or of a formal thought disorder. He denied an intention to harm or kill himself or others. He was cognitively intact.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Trevor Lewis's symptoms align with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).  Specifically, his preoccupation with germs and COVID-19, along with his excessive cleaning rituals and insistence on others adhering to his rules, point towards OCD.

Since age 13, he had been **excessively preoccupied with his scarred skin, thinning hair, asymmetrical ears, and wimpy and inadequately muscular body build**. Although he looked normal, Mr. Mancini was **completely convinced that he looked ugly and hideous**, and he believed that other people talked about him and made fun of him because of his appearance.\n\n**Mr. Mancini spent 5-6 hours a day compulsively checking his disliked body areas in mirrors and other reflecting surfaces such as windows, excessively styling his hair to create an illusion of fullness, pulling on his ears to try to even them up, and comparing his appearance with that of others.** He compulsively picked his skin, sometimes using razor blades, to try to clear it up. He lifted weights daily and regularly wore several layers of T-shirts to look bigger. He almost always wore a cap to hide his hair. He had received dermatological treatment for his skin concerns but felt it had not helped.\n\n**Mr. Mancini missed several months of high school because he was too preoccupied to do schoolwork, felt compelled to leave class to check mirrors, and was too self-conscious to be seen by others; for these reasons, he was unable to attend college.** He became socially withdrawn and did not date because \"no girl would want to go out with someone as ugly as me.\" He often considered suicide because he felt that \"life was not worth living if I look like a freak\" and because he felt isolated and ostracized because of his ugliness. His parents expressed concern over his violent outbursts, which occurred when he was feeling especially angry and distressed over how he looked or when they tried to pull him away from the mirror.\n\n**Mr. Mancini reported depressed mood, anhedonia, worthlessness, poor concentration, and suicidal ideation, all of which he attributed to his appearance concerns.** To self-medicate his distress over his appearance, he drank alcohol and smoked marijuana. He used protein powder to build up muscle but denied use of anabolic steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs or drugs of abuse. He had distressing and problematic anxiety in social situations during his late teens that he attributed to feeling stupid, but he denied recent social anxiety that was unrelated to his appearance concerns.\n\n**Mr. Mancini had no significant medical history and was taking no medication. His mother had obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).**\n\n**Mr. Mancini was neatly dressed and groomed and wore a baseball cap. He had no obvious physical defects. His eye contact was poor.

He was completely convinced that he was ugly and was certain that other people talked about him and laughed at him because of his physical appearance; he had no other psychotic symptoms. He believed his appearance defects were real and not attributable to a psychiatric disorder.**",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Mancini's symptoms align with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) with poor to absent insight (6B21.1). His preoccupation with perceived flaws in his appearance, compulsive behaviors to address them, and significant distress caused by these beliefs are consistent with BDD criteria.  His lack of acceptance for alternative explanations regarding his appearance further supports this diagnosis. "

She had never taken any psychiatric medication but had completed a course of **cognitive-behavioral therapy** for a previous depressive episode 5 years earlier.\n\n**Ms. Nichols's medical history was unremarkable.** She lived alone in a two-bedroom apartment and had no family or friends nearby. She had a university degree and worked as a part-time sales assistant in a charity thrift shop. She said she had dated in college but had somehow been too busy in recent years.\n\nOn initial examination, she was an articulate, well-dressed woman who was coherent and cooperative. **She was clearly in a low mood.** She complained about poor concentration and difficulties getting organized. She denied any substance misuse.\n\nThe clinician noted that **Ms. Nichols's purse was filled with bills and other papers.** When asked, the patient initially shrugged it off, indicating that she carried around her office. When the interviewer inquired further, it emerged that Ms. Nichols had had difficulty discarding important business papers, newspapers, and magazines for as long as she could remember. She felt that it all started when her mother got rid of her old toys when she was age 12. Now, many years later, Ms. Nichols's apartment had become filled with books, stationery, crafts, plastic packages, cardboard boxes, and all sorts of other things. She said she knew it was a little crazy, but these items could be handy one day. She said, Waste not, want not. She also reported that many of her possessions were beautiful, unique, and irreplaceable, or had strong sentimental value. **The thought of discarding any of these possessions caused her great distress.**\n\nOver a series of interviews, the clinician developed a clearer understanding of the extent of the problem. Rooms in Ms. Nichols's apartment had begun to fill when she was in her early 30s, and by the time of the interview, **she had little room to live.** Her kitchen was almost entirely full, so she used a mini fridge and a toaster oven that she had wedged into piles of paper in the hallway. She ate her meals in the only available chair. At night, she moved a pile of papers from the bed onto that chair so she could sleep. Ms. Nichols continued to buy from the charity thrift store where she worked and also picked up daily free newspapers that she planned to read in the future.\n\n**Embarrassed by the condition of her apartment, she had told no one about her behavior and had invited no one into her apartment for at least 15 years.** She also avoided social functions and dating, because-despite being naturally sociable and very lonely-she knew she would be unable to reciprocate with invitations to her home. She was surprised to have told the clinician, because she had not told even her own mother, but she would like help. She declined the clinician's offer of a home visit or a telehealth visit but did offer some photographs of her living room from her telephone's camera. The photographs showed furniture, papers, boxes, and clothes piled from floor to ceiling.\n\nMs. Nichols described **long-standing feelings of sadness and loneliness, as well as anxiety whenever she tried to clean up or whenever someone tried to befriend her.** She denied other psychiatric symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, obsessions, and compulsive behavior.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on Wendy Nichols's symptoms of hoarding items despite her living situation being severely impacted, the most likely diagnosis according to the ICD-11 is Unspecified Hoarding Disorder.

Stein, M.D., Ph.D.**\n\n**Zoe Oliver** was a 22-year-old single woman who presented to her general practitioner after reading a magazine article about **trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder)**. She had never previously told anyone other than her mother about her hair pulling, but the magazine had indicated that it was fairly common and treatable. She was pessimistic that anything would work, but she and her mother agreed that she should seek help.\n\n**Ms. Oliver's hair pulling** most often took place as a ritual when she returned home from her job as a paralegal. She would search for hairs of a particular texture from the crown of her head (though she also pulled from her eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic region). She felt intense relief if the hair came out with its root. She would then typically bite off the root of the hair and swallow the rest of the hair. She had never experienced any gastrointestinal symptoms after hair swallowing. She said the hair pulling had begun at age 12, and she had never known anyone with similar behaviors.\n\n**Ms. Oliver fought hard to stop the behavior** and, at times, had been able to stop for several months at a time. When the hair pulling returned, she would again feel ashamed and angry at herself. Scarves and hats covered the bald patch, but she would usually withdraw from friends and boyfriends to avoid being caught.\n\nEven when demoralized about the behavior, **Ms. Oliver did not have vegetative symptoms of depression**. Aside from fears of being found out, she lacked prominent anxiety. She denied obsessions, compulsions, hoarding, tics, and preoccupations with either bodily defects or having an illness. She also had no history of a range of other body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as lip biting or cheek chewing, in either herself or her close family members.\n\nWhen asked what she would do if she could not find the right kind of hair to pull, she admitted that she would often **pick at her skin or at a scab**. The scab's coming off in just the right way led to a feeling of relief that was similar to that which she experienced when hair pulling. She would also sometimes chew and swallow her scabs. Ms. Oliver often picked at scabs on her back so that the lesions would not be easily visible to others. Nevertheless, the resultant scarring did lead her to avoid situations like beach parties and dates and other situations where her behavior might be exposed.",

At the time of the adoption, Adriana's medical records were reviewed by a local pediatrician, who found no problems aside from growth parameters that were all below the 5th percentile. When the adoptive parents met her at the orphanage, Adriana approached without shyness and visited easily with them. The parents had been pleasantly reassured by the child's happy demeanor and her spontaneous, warm hugs.\n\nNot long after her adoption, Adriana began to clearly seek out her mother for comfort when distressed or hurt. At most other times, however, Adriana did not distinguish between strangers and her family. In the grocery store, she would warmly hug whoever was waiting next to them in line. In group and family settings, she would frequently try to sit in the laps of people she had barely met. Once, at a shopping mall, she tried to leave with another family. Her parents were concerned that this behavior might put her at risk of abduction or abuse.\n\nCompared with other children her age, Adriana had trouble taking turns and sitting for circle time at school. She interrupted, intruded into classmates' play space, and occasionally hit others. Small triggers upset her for prolonged periods.

Her mother stayed home for Adriana's first year in the United States, but Adriana had been attending a half-day child care program for the past year. Her mother noted progress in the child's development, although she remained language delayed, with comprehension better than productive language. She was slower than classmates in developing school readiness skills, but her gross and fine motor skills were considered average. Her sleep and appetite were fine. She had gained weight, but her head circumference remained just below the 5th percentile.\n\nOn examination, she was a pleasant, well-groomed girl who appeared younger than her age.

Although covered in blood, he escaped without physical injury.\n\n**Bethany and Charles, 2 Days Later:** **Two days later, both Ms. Pinsky and Mr. Quigley considered themselves nervous wrecks.** Grateful that they were alive and uninjured, they nevertheless found themselves extremely anxious and on edge. They jumped at the slightest noise. They kept watching television for the latest information about the shooting, but every time there was actual videotaped footage of the event, they experienced panic attacks, broke out into a sweat, were unable to calm down, and could not stop thinking about the traumatic event.

The car he was in was hit squarely on the driver's side, which caused the car to roll over once and come to rest right side up. **The collision of metal on metal made an extremely loud noise.** The driver of the car, a high school classmate, was knocked unconscious for a short period and was bleeding from a gash in his forehead.\n\nUpon seeing his injured friend, Dylan became afraid that his friend might be dead. His friend in the back seat of the car was frantically trying to unlatch her seat belt. Dylan's door was jammed, and Dylan feared that their car might catch fire while he was stuck in it. After a few minutes, the driver, Dylan, and the other passenger were able to exit through the passenger doors and move away from the car. They realized that the driver of the SUV was unharmed and had already called the police. An ambulance was on its way. All three were transported to a local emergency room, where they were attended to and released to their parents' care after a few hours.\n\n**Dylan had not had a good night's sleep since the accident.** He often awoke in the middle of the night with his heart racing, visualizing oncoming headlights. He was having trouble concentrating and was unable to effectively complete his homework. His parents, who had begun to drive him to and from school, noticed that he was anxious every time they pulled out of a driveway or crossed an intersection. Although he had recently received his driving permit, he refused to practice driving with his father. He was also unusually short-tempered with his parents, his younger sisters, and his friends. He had recently gone to see a movie but had walked out of the theater before the movie started; he complained that the sound system was too loud. His concerned parents tried to talk to him about his stress, but he would irritably cut them off. After doing poorly on an important exam, however, he accepted the encouragement of a favorite teacher to go to a psychiatrist.\n\nWhen seen, Dylan described additional difficulties. **He hated that he was jumpy around loud noises, and he could not shake the image of his injured and unresponsive friend.** He had waves of anger toward the driver of the SUV.

Mr. Reynolds indicated that he had had these symptoms for decades, but that he had finally agreed to get treated because his wife seemed desperate that he get in better control.\n\nMr. Reynolds indicated that he **always felt on guard, especially while in public**. When unexpectedly startled by sudden noises, he tended to fly into a rage. That was apparently one reason he had chosen to be a self-employed electrician: he could work by himself. Similarly, he enjoyed hunting and gardening, activities that he could enjoy in quiet solitude.\n\nReluctantly, he described **intrusive memories of watching his fellow soldiers die in the field, which caused him enormous shame, guilt, and sadness**. Several times a week, he awakes in a panicky sweat after a combat nightmare, although, as he said, It's ridiculous. Those guys have been dead for 50 years.\n\nAlthough these symptoms are very distressing, **Mr. Reynolds is most worried about his hair-trigger temper**. Without cause, he finds himself antagonizing other drivers who cut him off, confronting strangers who stand too close to him in checkout lines, and shifting into attack mode when approached from behind by others. He springs into this aggressive mode automatically, without a thought or consideration of the circumstances. Although he keeps a handgun in the console of his car for self-protection, Mr. Reynolds has no intention of harming others. He is always remorseful after a threatening incident and worries that he might inadvertently hurt someone. Most recently, while drifting off to sleep on his physician's examination table, a nurse touched his foot, and he leapt up and began cursing in a threatening manner. He felt as if he were back on guard duty, when he was accidentally dozing, and an incoming mortar round stunned him into action. His reaction scared both the nurse and himself.\n\nMr. Reynolds's symptoms apparently began soon after he left Vietnam, where he served as a field radio operator. He never sought help for his symptoms, apparently because of his independent and self-reliant nature. After retirement as a self-employed electrician, he spent almost all of his time at home. During these past few years, his wife and adult children became more aware of his various symptoms, including how they were putting a severe strain on his family relationships and overall happiness.\n\nMr. Reynolds was raised in a loving family that struggled financially as Midwestern farmers. At age 20, Mr. Reynolds was drafted into the U.S. Army and deployed to Vietnam. He described himself as having been upbeat and happy prior to his army induction. He said he enjoyed basic training and his first few weeks in Vietnam, until one of his comrades got killed. At that point, all he cared about was getting home alive, even if it meant killing others. His personality changed from that of a happy-go-lucky farm boy to a terrified, overprotective soldier. Upon returning to civilian life, he managed to get a graduate business degree, but he became a self-employed electrician because of his need to stay isolated in his work. In his retirement, he hoped to volunteer, garden, and get some peace and quiet. It turned out, however, that his retirement was much like the rest of his adult life: although he could occasionally settle into one of his hobbies, most of his days were filled with tension, guilt, and arguments.\n\nDespite having used alcohol and marijuana during his early adulthood, he had not consumed excessive alcohol for several decades or used marijuana since the age of 30. He had no legal history.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Reynolds was a well-groomed man who appeared **anxious and somewhat guarded**. He was coherent and articulate. His speech was at a normal rate, but the pace accelerated when he discussed disturbing content. He denied depression but was anxious. His affect was somewhat constricted but appropriate to content. His thought process was coherent and linear. He denied all suicidal and homicidal ideation.\n\nHe had no psychotic symptoms, delusions, or hallucinations. He had very good insight. He was well oriented and seemed to have above-average intelligence.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Eric Reynolds most likely suffers from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  His symptoms, including flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, anger outbursts, and avoidance of situations reminiscent of his trauma, align with the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.  The onset of these symptoms shortly after his return from Vietnam further supports this diagnosis."

Munday, Ph.D. Jamie Miller Abelson, M.S.W.\n\n**Franklin Sims was a 21-year-old single African American man who sought treatment at a university-affiliated community mental health care clinic because he felt stressed out, withdrawn from friends, and worried about money.** He said he had been feeling depressed for 3 months, and he attributed the nosedive to the end of a 3-year romantic relationship shortly after he and his girlfriend had seriously discussed marriage.\n\n**Mr. Sims, the son of working-class parents, had supported himself financially since high school and was accustomed to feeling nervous about making ends meet.** He was angered by his girlfriend's decision to end the relationship, particularly her failure to understand his concerns about establishing financial stability. He increasingly ruminated about money, his grades, and his future.\n\n**Mr. Sims was a full-time undergraduate employed as a full-time midnight-shift warehouse worker.** He was accustomed to this schedule, but he had increasingly found it difficult to concentrate in class after staying awake all night at the warehouse. When he had a day off, his sleep and energy were fine, and he still enjoyed hanging out with his friends. His appetite was unchanged, and his physical health was good. His grades had recently declined, however, and he had become increasingly discouraged about money and about being his family's first college student. His parents did not understand why he had decided to attend an out-of-state university, and he was increasingly dissatisfied with life on the predominantly white college campus after some recent experiences of racial discrimination. He had not previously sought any type of mental health care services, but a supportive cousin suggested that he see a therapist after he had told her that he sometimes just felt like giving up.\n\n**Mr. Sims was an only child-a self-described good student and popular kid.** High school was complicated by his parents' periodic unemployment, financial strains, and related marital difficulties.\n\n**He started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana in ninth grade, but neither had ever caused him difficulty.** At the time of the evaluation, he said he occasionally had a beer or marijuana cigarette at parties, but that he didn't have the time, money, or inclination to get intoxicated.\n\n**On examination, Mr. Sims was punctual, cooperative, pleasant, attentive, appropriately dressed, and well groomed.** He spoke coherently. He appeared generally worried and constricted, but he smiled appropriately several times during the interview. He said he felt bad about his declining grades, but he denied feeling guilty or worthless. He had a quiet, dry sense of humor. He denied current suicidality, homicidality, and psychosis. He was cognitively intact, and his insight and judgment were considered good.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on Mr. Sims' symptoms of depression, stress, and rumination about finances and relationships, a possible diagnosis from the ICD-11 would be F32.0 (Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode).  His difficulty concentrating due to sleep deprivation could also contribute to his distress."

She had just been admitted to the medical service for shortness of breath. She was subsequently found to have a unilateral pleural effusion. Ms. Trentino had already been through several rounds of chemotherapy over the prior few months. At the time of the consultation, she was awaiting the results of thoracentesis to assess for pulmonary metastases.\n\nInterviewed separately, **Ms. Trentino and her two sons** agreed that until this hospitalization, she had never previously been especially depressed or anxious but had instead been the family's rock. She had never seen a therapist, taken psychiatric medication, or used alcohol, opiates, or illicit drugs. Her family history was notable for a father who drank to excess, which she described as the reason she had never tasted alcohol.\n\nOn examination, the patient was a well-groomed woman sitting in bed with an oxygen nasal cannula in place, wringing her hands and dabbing at her eyes with a wet tissue. She was cooperative and coherent. She was visibly dysphoric, with a constricted, worried affect. She reported being extremely worried about the pending thoracentesis study. She knew that metastases could mean a death sentence and said, \"I want to be alive for my son's marriage this year.\" She added tearfully, \"I've been through so much with the illness already. . . . When is it going to stop?\"\n\n**Ms. Trentino** endorsed poor sleep and impaired concentration since her admission to the hospital 5 days earlier. She had been eating less than usual. She said she was too sad and worried to do her usual daily crossword. She denied confusion and psychotic symptoms. She appeared cognitively intact, and her Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 29 out of 30, with 1 lost point for incorrect recall of an object after 5 minutes.\n\nShe adamantly denied suicidal ideation, again speaking of her love for her two children.\n\n**Ms. Trentino's vital signs** were notable for an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air (corrected to 99% on nasal cannula), and her chest X ray showed a large left-sided pleural effusion. Neurological examination was unremarkable. Her basic lab results were otherwise within normal limits. Collateral information from nursing staff indicated that she rang her call bell frequently throughout the day to ask about medication and test details.",

Pfeffer, M.D.**\n\n**Hannah, a 16-year-old white girl with no past psychiatric history, was brought to the hospital emergency department following an overdose of unknown amounts of sedating medications.** Upon arrival, Hannah had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8, indicating severe compromise. She was intubated and admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. After stabilization over several days, she was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit.\n\n**Current regulatory practice mandates suicide screening for all patients; in this case, Hannah screened positive for suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).**\n\nWhile Hannah was intubated, her parents and her best friend agreed that she appeared to have been in her usual good mood until the evening of the overdose. The best friend reported that a different friend had texted Hannah that she had seen Hannah's boyfriend kissing another girl. Within a couple of hours of reading that text, Hannah was found by her parents, confused and barely arousable. On her desk was a note: I just want to sleep forever. The parents immediately called an ambulance.\n\n**Psychiatric history was notable for an absence of depression, suicidal ideation, self- injurious behaviors, mania, or psychosis.** She had no previous psychiatric contacts, hospitalizations, or psychotherapy. According to her parents and her best friend, Hannah never used cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, or other illicit drugs. She had no legal history\n\n**Hannah lived with her parents and two younger sisters.** Her academic performance as an eleventh grader at a local public school was stellar. She reported that she hoped to be a physician or attorney. Her best friend said she had been cheerful earlier in the day.\n\n**Family psychiatric history was notable for her mother having an anxiety disorder for which she was prescribed clonazepam and alprazolam.** As a late adolescent, the mother had also made two suicide attempts by medication overdose. Her father had chronic back pain from a sports injury, for which he took oxycodone. Extended family history was notable for a paternal uncle with an alcohol use disorder. No one in the extended family had committed suicide.\n\n**After she was extubated, Hannah said she felt fine, and that the suicidal feelings were completely gone.** She also said that she had been doing well until the minute she read about her boyfriend kissing another girl. Hannah denied having any disturbances of mood, anxiety, sleep, appetite, energy, or concentration, either at the time of the evaluation or in the weeks leading up to the overdose. She denied somatic complaints, psychotic features, and any history of self-injury, such as cutting. She denied any history of trauma or substance use. She recalled that the thought to die came out of the blue, and that she immediately wrote the suicide note and gathered medications from herparents' medicine cabinet. In retrospect, she was horrified by the overdose and grateful that she was alive.\n\n**Hannah continued to deny depression and suicidality throughout her hospitalization.** She was discharged to outpatient care within the hospital clinic. No psychotropic medication was prescribed. She was seen weekly for cognitive-behavioral therapy that focused on coping skills when angry or disappointed. After 6 months, Hannah was noted to be doing well and to have been consistently free of suicidal ideation, intent, or behavior. At that point, Hannah, her parents, and the psychologist agreed to end the treatment, with the understanding that she would restart treatment should she experience any trouble coping.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on Hannah's presentation, including her sudden overdose after learning about her boyfriend's actions and lack of previous psychiatric history,  a diagnosis of **Acute Stress Disorder** is plausible. Her temporary suicidal ideation and distress align with the criteria for this disorder.   However, more information would be needed to confirm a definitive diagnosis. "

        "clinical_case": "**John W. Barnhill, M.D.**\n\n**Isaac Ulysse**, a 29-year-old surgery resident at a large urban hospital, was referred to his employee assistance program because of burnout. Dr. Ulysse's supervisors had become concerned about his appearing increasingly distracted and sad. After performing **very well** at their medical school and during the first 2 years of surgery training, Dr. Ulysse was now manifesting some problems, with his most recent performance review being notable for uncharacteristic sloppiness and lateness. Dr. Ulysse had shrugged off two referrals, but after being told that he was being released from work until he got clearance from psychiatry, he agreed to an evaluation.\n\nDr. Ulysse stated that he was fine, just a little burned out. He'd always prided himself on having more energy than everyone else, but he'd started getting worn down during the **COVID-19 pandemic**. He said he was sleeping poorly, was always tired, and was having trouble concentrating. After about 20 minutes, he asked if he could leave, that he felt better already. The psychiatrist explained that she would need to meet with him at least a few times before she could allow him to go back to work.\n\nReminded that he wasn't yet ready to go back to work, Dr. Ulysse appeared to slump in his seat. When the psychiatrist asked him to say more, he replied that he hated being this way, hated being weak.\n\nHe said he knew he had burnout. He'd read up on it, and he felt **exhausted, cynical** about his being a cog in the medical-industrial complex, and less able to finish his daily work. He thought he might also have a depressive disorder, given that he was sad just about every day and also felt tired, worthless, and unable to sleep and concentrate normally.\n\nHe said this had been going on for 12 or 18 months, but he'd been good at hiding things until recently. Dr. Ulysse asked whether the psychiatrist could diagnose him with burnout, since he'd prefer not to get a label that is a career killer, at least for a surgeon. He said he would be completely adherent with an antidepressant medication if the psychiatrist would let him go back to work. When asked if he felt suicidal, he responded that he had always thought that was a ridiculous question: If you're really serious about suicide, why tell somebody who has 911 on speed dial? But no, I'm not going to kill myself.\n\nAt this point, the psychiatrist asked for more background information. Dr. Ulysse was the only child born to a pharmacist and a French professor, who had left Haiti when he was born. He had grown up in a suburban area where he was often the only **Black child** in his grade. When asked if that was difficult for him, he looked skeptical. Yeah, he said, I know all about microaggressions and structural racism, all that stuff, but my strategy was to always be smarter, funnier, nicer, and more athletic than everybody else. I always had a confident smile on my face, and now nothing makes me happy. My nickname at my fancy high school was Superman. I literally dated the homecoming queen, and nobody seemed to mind about the Black/white thing. At that point, he laughed and added, well, except for my Gran, my dad's mother, who lived with us when I was growing up. She thought I was asking for trouble.\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, Dr. Ulysse began to quietly cry. When asked to say more, he explained that his parents worked all the time when he was young, so his grandmother lived with them and took care of him throughout his school years. She had died of **COVID-19** about 18 months earlier. Since then, he described thinking about her all the time and having become increasingly preoccupied by his failure to convince her to get the COVID vaccine.\n\nHe said he knew it was ridiculous, but he had partially believed her when she had insisted that she was able to protect everyone in the family from the virus. Did I mention my Gran was a Catholic witch, and a very good one? Dr. Ulysse added that although he knew she was dead, part of him continued to expect her to walk through the door, and he looked up multiple times every day, expecting her to be there. He spent long hours reviewing his inability to convince her to get the vaccine as well as his decision not to visit her for months for fear of infecting her. He awoke with nightmares most nights. He didn't remember the content of the dreams very well, but they tended to be about his grandmother disappearing and him being unable to help. He noted that he had become increasingly angry and bitter at colleagues, his parents, and his ex- girlfriend. Since she had moved out of their apartment 6 months earlier, he hadn't spoken to her or seen any of his friends. His parents called frequently and have tried to kidnap him for a weekend with family, but they appear to have gotten frustrated that he was being so stubborn. He said that he was okay watching TV-where he focused on pestilence and wars-but he just felt too numb to talk to people. He also stated that he barely knew who he was anymore, and that his job as a surgery trainee had come to seem irrelevant if it meant that he couldn't even help his family. Although he was definitely not going to kill himself, and he knew the whole idea was stupid, he did daydream almost every day about being dead so that he could see his grandmother again.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided context, Dr. Ulysse's symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of  Delusional disorder, in partial remission, due to his preoccupation with his grandmother and beliefs about her influence despite her death. Additionally, he exhibits signs of major depressive disorder with symptoms such as persistent sadness, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and loss of interest."

She reported greater benefit from psychotherapies based on **cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy**. Electroconvulsive therapy had been suggested, but she had refused. She had been hospitalized twice for suicidal ideation and severe self-cutting that required stitches.\n\n**Ms. Vaughan reported that previous therapists had focused on the likelihood of trauma, but she casually dismissed the possibility that she had ever been abused.** It had been her younger sister who had reported weird sexual touching by their father when Ms.Vaughan was 13. There had never been a police investigation, but her father had apologized to the patient and her sister as part of a resultant church intervention and an inpatient treatment for alcoholism and sex addiction. She denied any feelings about these events and said, 'He took care of the problem. I have no reason to be mad at him.'\n\n**Ms. Vaughan reported little memory for her life between the ages of about 7 and 13 years.** Her siblings would joke about her inability to recall family holidays, school events, and vacation trips. She explained her amnesia by saying, 'I don't remember anything because nothing happened.'\n\nShe reported a good relationship with both parents. Her father remained controlling toward her mother and still had anger issues, but had been abstinent from alcohol for 16 years. On closer questioning, **Ms. Vaughan reported that her self-injurious and suicidal behavior primarily occurred after visits to see her family or when her parents surprised her by visiting.**\n\nMs. Vaughan described being socially withdrawn until high school, at which point she became academically successful and a member of numerous teams and clubs. She did well in college. She excelled at her job and was regarded as a gifted teacher of autistic children. She described several friendships of many years. **She reported difficulty with intimacy with men, experiencing intense fear and disgust at any attempted sexual advances. Whenever she did get at all involved with a man, she felt intense shame and a sense of her own badness, although she felt worthless at other times as well.** She tended to sleep poorly and often felt tired.\n\nShe denied use of alcohol or drugs. She added that even the smell of alcohol made her feel like throwing up.\n\nOn mental status examination, the patient was well groomed and cooperative. Her responses were coherent and goal directed, but often devoid of emotional content. She appeared sad and constricted. She described herself as numb. She denied hallucinations, confusion, and a current intention to kill herself. However, **thoughts of suicide were always around.**\n\nMore specific questions led Ms. Vaughan to deny that she had ongoing amnesia for daily life, particularly denying ever being told of behavior she could not recall, unexplained possessions, subjective time loss, fugue episodes, or inexplicable fluctuations in skills, habits, and/or knowledge. She denied a sense of subjective self-division, hallucinations, inner voices, or passive influence symptoms. **She denied flashbacks or intrusive memories, but she did report recurrent nightmares of being chased by a dangerous man from whom she could not escape.** She reported difficulty concentrating, although she was hyperfocused at work. She reported an intense startle reaction. She said that she often found herself silently counting and singing rather than let herself daydream.\n\nShe added that she was very careful, checking multiple times every night to ensure that her doors were locked. When she got anxious, she found that rearranging her furniture helped her feel safer.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Ms. Vaughan's symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with fair to good insight (6B20.0).  Her self-injurious and suicidal behaviors, along with her intense fears and compulsions regarding safety (locking doors, rearranging furniture), align with OCD criteria. The fact that she can sometimes entertain alternative explanations for her experiences points towards fair to good insight."

Mr. Waldron did not attend the evaluation session, telling his RA that everybody gets bummed after a breakup-I'll be fine. When Mr. Waldron seemed strange and out of it, his RA made another appointment and then accompanied Ken to the meeting.\n\nIn that initial session, Mr. Waldron was hesitant but revealed that he had been crushed by the breakup. While he had previously been an excellent student, he'd quit doing homework and just looked out the window during class. He noticed that his grades had declined markedly, but I don't seem to care. Although he said he felt lonely, he also admitted to steadily deleting incoming texts, so that he rarely communicated with his friends and family.\n\nWhen asked to describe other symptoms of depression, Mr. Waldron replied that he didn't have anything to say. He said that his mind felt blank, as usual. He added that he also felt increasingly detached from his physical body, going about his daily activities like a robot. He said he felt so disconnected that he often wondered if he were dead or living in a dream, or just had no self.\n\nMr. Waldron said that he'd been depressed for a few weeks after the breakup. He said he'd never been in love before and was shocked when Jill told him she needed time apart. For weeks afterward, he felt sad and a little desperate, but he'd continued to see friends and go to class; however, at some point, things began to change. He said he started feeling numb, unreal, and disconnected, but it was all a little fuzzy.\n\nMr. Waldron described a time-limited bout of extreme anxiety in tenth grade. At that time, panic attacks had begun and then escalated in severity and frequency over 2 months. During those attacks, he had felt very detached, as if everything around him was unreal. The symptoms sometimes lasted for several hours and were reminiscent of his current complaints. The onset appeared to coincide with his mother's entry into a psychiatric hospital. When she was discharged, all of his symptoms cleared rapidly. He did not seek treatment at that time.\n\nMr. Waldron also described experiencing transient feelings of unreality in elementary school, just after his parents divorced and his father left young Jason and his mother, who had a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. His childhood was significant for pervasive loneliness and the sense that he was the only adult in the family. His mother was only marginally functional, with a few actively psychotic episodes. His father rarely visited but did provide enough money for them to continue to live in reasonable comfort. Jason often stayed with his grandparents on weekends, but in general, he and his mother lived a very isolated life. He did well in school and had a few close friends, but he largely kept to himself and rarely brought friends home. Jill would have been the first girlfriend to meet his mother.\n\nMr. Waldron denied using any drugs, in particular cannabis, hallucinogens, or ketamine, and his urine toxicology was negative. Although his home life featured emotional neglect by both parents and emotional abuse when his mother was actively psychotic, he denied physical or sexual abuse. He denied any psychiatric history of mania, psychosis, or other past psychiatric symptoms, except as described above. He also specifically denied amnesia, blackouts, multiple identities, hallucinations, paranoia, and other unusual thoughts or experiences.\n\n**Results of routine laboratory tests, a blood toxicology screen, and a physical examination were normal, as were a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan and an electroencephalogram. Consultations with an otorhinolaryngologist and a neurologist were noncontributory.**",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Ken Waldron's symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of Depressive Disorder (F32).

Her family reported that Ms. Zayas reacted initially with inordinate calm.\n\nConcerned, relatives discreetly followed her around in their small apartment for several hours. She did not speak but instead engaged in repetitive, unnecessary tasks such as folding and unfolding clothes.\n\nThat afternoon, standing at the washing machine, she had cried out, grabbed a bottle of bleach, and tried to drink from it. Her brother knocked it away. She fell to the ground, shaking, screaming, and crying. This episode lasted a few seconds, after which she lay as if dead for a few minutes. The family recalled no tonic-clonic movements, tongue biting, or loss of sphincter control. When the ambulance arrived, Ms. Zayas was crying softly, repeating the name of her fiancï¿½, and was generally unresponsive to questions. After medical staff treated mild burns to her lips, she was triaged to the psychiatry department.\n\nOver the next few hours, Ms. Zayas became more responsive. During a clinical interview done in Spanish, she reported being struck numb (insensible) by the news of her fiancï¿½'s death and described a sense of being disconnected from her body, her emotions, and her surroundings. These symptoms were still present in the ER but diminished over several hours. She also described amnesia for what occurred from the moment when she cried out and her vision went dark (oscura), to when she awoke in the ER.\n\nWhile being kept under observation for 24 hours, Ms. Zayas had two more episodes of sudden agitation, crying, and screaming, during which she attempted to scratch her face and to leave the room. Because she responded quickly to verbal intervention and reassuring physical contact, she was not given medications or placed in restraints, but was kept on one-to-one observation. Her laboratory test results were unremarkable, as were an electroencephalogram and a lumbar puncture.\n\nOn examination, she was crying softly, her mood was sad, and she said she did not remember making a suicide attempt. She was oriented to time, person, and place; had no psychotic symptoms; and denied current suicidal ideation.\n\nMs. Zayas was transferred to an inpatient psychiatric unit for evaluation. She initially had difficulty falling asleep and had sad, scary dreams about her fiancï¿½. She denied recalling anything from the hours after she tried to swallow bleach. She made efforts to avoid thinking about her fiancï¿½ and was disturbed by intrusive recollections of their time together, but she never met DSM-5 criteria for acute stress disorder or major depressive disorder. Her symptoms had improved significantly after 1 week. She took no medications at the hospital and was discharged after 10 days with follow-up to outpatient care. She attended a single appointment 1 month later, at which point she and her family agreed that she was episodically sad about the death of her fiancï¿½ but essentially back to her normal self. At that point, she was lost to follow-up.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Ms. Zayas's symptoms suggest a diagnosis of **Acute Stress Disorder (6A80.9)**.  Her reaction to her fiancé's death involved dissociative and emotional distress with recurrent, distressing memories of the event.

A note sent ahead revealed that she had been tearful and frustrated at her last medical appointment, and her doctor, who had been struggling to control the patient's persistent back pain, felt that an evaluation by a psychiatrist might be helpful.\n\n**Greeting Ms. Adams in the waiting room, the psychiatrist was struck by both her appearance and her manner:** here was a woman with shaggy silver hair and dark sunglasses, seated in a wheelchair, who offered a limp handshake and a plaintive sigh before asking the psychiatrist if he would mind pushing her wheelchair into his office. She was tired from a long commute, and, she explained, \"Nobody on the street offered to help me out. Can you believe that?\"\n\n**Once settled, Ms. Adams stated that she had been suffering from unbearable back pain for the previous 13 months.** On the night that changed everything, she had locked herself out of her apartment and, while trying to climb in through a fire escape, had fallen and fractured her pelvis, coccyx, right elbow, and three ribs. Although she did not require surgery, she was bed-bound for 6 weeks and then underwent several months of physical therapy. Daily opioid medication had been only moderately helpful. She had seen a dozen doctors of various specialties and tried multiple treatments, including anesthetic injections and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy, but her pain was unrelenting. Throughout this ordeal and for years previously, Ms. Adams smoked cannabis daily, explaining that a joint enjoyed in hourly puffs softened her pain and helped her to relax. She did not drink alcohol or use other illicit drugs.\n\n**Prior to the accident, Ms. Adams had worked at a neighborhood salon for more than 20 years.** She was proud to have had a large number of devoted clients, and she relished the camaraderie with her colleagues, whom she referred to as \"my real family.\" She had been unable to return to work since her accident on account of the pain. \"These doctors keep telling me I'm good to go back to work,\" she said with visible anger, \"but they don't know what I'm going through.\" Her voice broke. \"They don't believe me. They think I'm lying.\"\n\n**She added that although friends had initially reached out after the accident, lately they had seemed less sympathetic.** She let incoming telephone calls go to voice mail most of the time because she just did not feel up to socializing on account of the pain. In the previous month, she had stopped bathing daily and gotten slack about cleaning her apartment. Without the structure of work, she often found herself up until 5:00 a.m., and pain woke her several times before she finally got out of bed in the afternoon. As for her mood, she said, \"I'm so depressed it's ridiculous.\" She often felt hopeless of any possibility of living without pain but denied ever thinking of suicide. She explained that her Catholic faith prevented her from considering taking her own life.\n\n**Ms. Adams had never seen a psychiatrist before and did not recall ever having felt depressed prior to her accident,** although she described a hot temper as a family trait. She spoke of only one meaningful romantic relationship, many years previously, with a woman who was emotionally abusive. When asked about any legal difficulties, she revealed several arrests for theft in her 20s. \"She was in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" she said, \"and was never convicted of a crime.\"",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided context and Ms. Adams's symptoms, a possible diagnosis could be  **Delusional disorder, in partial remission (6A24.1)**.  Her persistent belief that doctors don't believe her pain and her feelings of hopelessness suggest ongoing delusional thinking.

She had intermittent **cold sensations in her extremities, face, ears, eyes, and nasal passages**. **Pulsating sensations in her eyes** were, she thought, more pronounced after a poor night's sleep. In recent months, she had developed **difficulty urinating, menstrual irregularity, and multiple muscle complaints, including right gluteal pain with a burning sensation into her right thigh**. She also had **neck stiffness with accompanying thoracic back spasms**.\n\nMs. Balaban's primary care physician had evaluated the initial symptoms and then referred her to a rheumatologist and a neurologist. The rheumatologist diagnosed **mechanical back pain without evidence of inflammatory arthritis**. She had also diagnosed **possible migraines with peripheral neuropathic and ocular symptoms**. The neurologist noted that Ms. Balaban was also being evaluated by a neurologist and a neuro-ophthalmologist at a nearby medical center. The other neurologist concluded her evaluation with a provisional diagnosis of **atypical migraine variant**, noting that the patient seemed to also have a **significant degree of depression, which might be aggravating the symptoms or even be an underlying precipitating factor**. A review of tests done at the two medical centers indicated that Ms. Balaban had received the following essentially normal tests: two electroencephalograms, an electromyogram, three brain and three spinal magnetic resonance images, two lumbar puncture studies, and serial laboratory exams. Psychiatric consultation had been recommended, but the patient declined until repeatedly urged by her primary care physician.\n\nMs. Balaban initially spoke to the psychiatrist primarily about her physical complaints. She was very frustrated that despite having seen several specialists, she had received no clear diagnosis, and she was still very concerned about her symptoms. She had started taking **fluoxetine and gabapentin**, prescribed by her primary care physician, and experienced partial improvement in her mood and some of her pains. She found it difficult to concentrate and complete her work and was spending a lot of time on the internet researching her symptoms. For the past several months, she had kept a spreadsheet that tried to link her symptoms to her blood pressure and pulse.\n\nShe also felt bad about not spending enough time with her children or husband, but just did not have the energy. She acknowledged bouts of **depressed mood** over the prior year with some **anhedonia and occasional thoughts of suicide** (she had considered crashing her car), but no anorexia or guilt. She described having experienced **premenstrual depressive symptoms** for about a year.\n\nMs. Balaban had been treated for **postpartum depression** 6 years earlier after the birth of her second child. **Family history was significant for cancer, depression, and hypertension**.\n\nMs. Balaban lived with her husband and their daughters, ages 10 and 6 years. Her husband was being treated for depression. The patient had graduated from college and was the longtime administrative assistant to a dean at the local university. She grew up in a small town in a rural area. She reported a happy childhood and denied any experiences of physical or sexual abuse. There was no history of a substance use disorder.\n\nOn mental status examination, the patient was **alert, casually but neatly dressed, cooperative, and not at all defensive**. Her **mood and affect were depressed**, and she demonstrated **psychomotor retardation**. There were no abnormalities of thought process or content, no abnormalities of perception, and no evident cognitive dysfunction.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Ms. Balaban's symptoms point towards  a diagnosis of Somatic Symptom Disorder (ICD-11 code: 6B40). Her preoccupation with physical symptoms despite extensive medical testing and the impact on her daily life align with this diagnosis. The context does not provide enough information to rule out other possibilities or definitively diagnose any specific disorder mentioned."

        "clinical_case": "**Robert Boland, M.D.**\n\n**Oscar Capek, a 43-year-old man, was brought by his wife to an emergency room (ER)** for what he described as a relapse of his chronic Lyme disease. He explained that he had been fatigued for a month and bedridden for a week. Then, saying he was too tired and confused to give much information, he asked the ER team to call his psychiatrist.\n\n**The psychiatrist reported that he had treated Mr. Capek for more than two decades.** He first saw Mr. Capek for a panic attack. It resolved with surprisingly small doses of clonazepam. After that, however, Mr. Capek continued to see him for help coping with his chronic illness. Initially a graduate student pursuing a master's degree in accounting, Mr. Capek dropped out of school over worries that the demands of his studies would exacerbate his disease. Since that time, his wife, a registered nurse, had been his primary support. He supplemented their income with small accounting jobs but limited these lest the stress affect his health.\n\n**Mr. Capek usually felt physically and emotionally well.** He deemed his occasional fatigue, anxiety, and concentration difficulties controllable and did not require treatment. Mr. Capek was typically averse to psychotropic medications and took a homeopathic approach to his disease, including exercise and proper nutrition. When his panic symptoms would reemerge, he used small doses (e.g., one-quarter of a 0.5-mg lorazepam pill). His psychiatric sessions were commonly concerned about his underlying disease; he often brought articles on chronic Lyme disease for discussion and was active in a local Lyme disease support group.\n\n**Mr. Capek's symptoms would occasionally worsen.** However, these worsenings occurred less than yearly, and these exacerbations usually related to some apparent stress. The worst episode had been 1 year earlier, when his wife briefly left him following his revelation of an affair. Mr. Capek expressed shame about his behavior toward his wife- both the affair and his inability to support her. He subsequently cut off contact with the other woman and attempted to expand his accounting work. The psychiatrist speculated that similar stress was behind his current symptoms.\n\n**The psychiatrist communicated regularly with Mr. Capek's internist.** His Lyme disease tests had thus far been negative. When the internist reported this, Mr. Capek became defensive and produced literature on the inaccuracy of Lyme disease testing. Eventually, the internist and the psychiatrist agreed on a conservative treatment approach with a neutral stance regarding the disease's validity.\n\n**On examination, Mr. Capek was a healthy, well-developed adult male.** He was anxious and spoke quietly with his eyes closed. He frequently lost his train of thought, but with encouragement and patience, he could give a detailed history consistent with the psychiatrist's account. Physical examination findings were unremarkable, and a standard laboratory screen was normal except for a slightly low hemoglobin value. The medical team chose to defer further Lyme testing, given the patient's many past negative tests. However, on hearing about the low hemoglobin, Mr. Capek became alarmed, dismissed reassurances, and insisted that the team investigate this further.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided context, Oscar Capek's case most closely aligns with  Hypochondriasis with fair to good insight (6B23.0). He presents with persistent worry about his health, despite negative test results and reassurance from medical professionals. He also demonstrates some insight by being open to alternative explanations for his symptoms at times."

Stern, M.D.**\n\n**Paulina Delcampo**, a 32-year-old single woman with epilepsy that was first diagnosed during adolescence, was admitted to an academic medical center after her family found her convulsing in her bedroom. Before she was taken to the emergency room (ER), emergency medical services administered several doses of lorazepam, with no change in her condition. On arrival at the ER, a loading dose of fosphenytoin was administered to her; it stopped the convulsive activity. Blood tests obtained in the ER revealed therapeutic levels of her usual antiepileptics and no evidence of any infection or metabolic disturbance. Urine toxicology screens were negative for the use of illicit substances. **Ms. Delcampo was admitted to the neurology service for further monitoring.**\n\nDuring her admission, a routine electroencephalogram (EEG) was ordered. Shortly after the study began, **Ms. Delcampo began convulsing; this prompted administration of intravenous (IV) lorazepam**. When the EEG was reviewed, no epileptiform activity was identified. Ms. Delcampo was placed on video-EEG (vEEG) monitoring, and her antiepileptics were tapered and discontinued. In the course of her monitoring, **Ms. Delcampo had several episodes of convulsive motor activity; however, none was associated with epileptiform activity on the EEG. Psychiatric consultation was requested.**\n\nOn interview, **Ms. Delcampo denied prior psychiatric evaluations, diagnoses, or treatments**. She denied having depressed mood or any disturbance of sleep, energy, concentration, or appetite. She reported no thoughts of harming herself or others. She endorsed no signs or symptoms consistent with mania or psychosis. There was no family history of psychiatric illness or substance abuse. Her examination revealed a well-groomed woman, sitting on her hospital bed with EEG leads in place. She was pleasant and engaged, and she made good eye contact. Cognitive testing revealed no deficits.\n\n**Ms. Delcampo noted that she had recently moved to the state to begin graduate school; she was excited about starting her studies and finally getting my career on track.** She denied any recent specific psychosocial stressors other than her move and said, My life is finally where I want it to be. She was future oriented and concerned about the impact that her seizures might have on her long-term health. She was worried that a protracted hospitalization might cause her to miss the first day of classes (only a week away from the time of the interview). Moreover, she was quite concerned about the costs of her hospitalization because her health insurance coverage did not begin until the school semester commenced and the payment for extended benefits coverage from her previous employer would have a significant impact on her budget.\n\nWhen the findings of the vEEG study were discussed with Ms. Delcampo, **she quickly became quite irritable, asking, So, everyone thinks I'm just making this up?** She was not calmed by her treaters' attempts to clarify that they did not believe her to be faking her symptoms or by their reassurance that her symptoms might be helped by structured therapy. **Ms. Delcampo pulled her EEG leads from her scalp, dressed herself, and left the hospital against medical advice.**",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, a diagnosis of  **Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self (F62.0)** is most appropriate for Ms. Delcampo. Her history of epilepsy and subsequent hospitalization are consistent with her desire to appear ill and elicit medical attention.  Her symptoms seem intentionally fabricated or exaggerated to gain sympathy and medical care despite the absence of EEG evidence for seizures."

        "clinical_case": "**Joseph F. Murray, M.D.**\n\n**A hospital-based psychiatric consultation-liaison service** was called to assess possible depression in **Rebecca Ehrlich, a 24-year-old woman** who had been hospitalized 2 days earlier for severe abdominal pain. She had been admitted through the emergency room for the latest flare-up of her underlying Crohn's disease. The consultation was called after the nurses became concerned that she was sad and lonely and was having a difficult time adjusting to her medical condition.\n\n**Ms. Ehrlich was interviewed by the medical student on the psychiatry service.** The patient indicated that the pain was excruciating and that she was neither sad nor lonely but was simply visiting from out of town, so no one knew she was even in the hospital. She told the medical student that her only previous therapy had been in college, when she went to student health services to get help for anxiety about test taking and her career choice. She had successfully completed a short course of cognitive-behavioral therapy, and the anxiety had not reappeared. She denied any other psychiatric history and had never taken psychiatric medication. In college, she studied psychology and worked part-time as a hospital orderly. Ms. Ehrlich had considered a career in medicine or nursing and asked the student how he had decided to go to medical school.\n\n**Ms. Ehrlich reported that she had previously worked regularly and had quite a few friends,** but that the recurrent abdominal pain had wrecked her social life and her job prospects. She had lost a job the year before because of absenteeism and had missed several job interviews due to her Crohn's flares. She had dated as a teenager but had been in no relationships since starting college. “These things were not the end of the world, but how would you feel?” As a member of an online bowel disorders support group, Ms. Ehrlich e-mailed other members on a daily basis. She added that the only person in the family who “got her” was an aunt who also had Crohn's disease.\n\n**The primary medical team was having difficulty obtaining collateral information from previous physicians,** but the medical student was able to contact Ms. Ehrlich's mother. She did not know the exact names or phone numbers of her daughter's medical providers but did recall some of the hospitals and could recall, approximately, some of the physicians' names. She added that her daughter had not wanted her to be involved in her care and had not told her she was out of town, much less that she was in the hospital. She did say that the Crohn's disease had been diagnosed 2 years earlier, during her daughter's last semester of college. The mother estimated that Ms. Ehrlich had been hospitalized at least six times, in contrast with the daughter's report of two earlier hospitalizations. Neither the gastrointestinal (GI) team nor the medical student was able to locate Ms. Ehrlich's primary gastroenterologist, whose name the patient could spell only phonetically.\n\n**On examination, Ms. Ehrlich was cooperative and conversant, and appeared comfortable.** Her speech was fluent. She appeared calm and unworried about her upcoming procedures. Her thought process was linear. She denied paranoia, hallucinations, or suicidality. Attention and both recent and remote memory were intact. She acknowledged that it had been difficult living with Crohn's disease, but she was optimistic that her symptoms would improve. She denied depressive symptoms. She looked sad at the beginning of the interview, but she appeared more engaged and euthymic the more she talked. She could not explain why the team was unable to locate her doctor and became irritated when the medical student pressed more specifically to elicit further details about her prior care. She was taken to have an endoscopy and a colonoscopy at the end of the interview.\n\n**Ms. Ehrlich's endoscopy and colonoscopy results were normal.** That evening, the medical student from psychiatry sat in with the GI team as they reviewed the normal results with the patient. She said she was relieved there was no longer anything seriously wrong with her. The GI team told her that she could be discharged the next morning and that she should have her internist call them. She readily agreed.\n\n**After the GI team left, Ms. Ehrlich told the student that she was feeling better already.** She quickly removed her own intravenous line and started to get dressed. The student went to get the primary GI team. When they returned, the patient was gone.\n\n**The medical student spent much of the next day calling hospitals and physicians that met descriptions provided by the patient and her mother.** That afternoon, one of the physicians called back and indicated that he had treated Ms. Ehrlich 6 months earlier at a hospital near her mother's home. That admission was strikingly similar: after a short hospitalization, she quickly fled from the hospital after a normal colonoscopy.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, it appears Rebecca Ehrlich does not currently display any significant mood symptoms.  Her history of anxiety and previous successful treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy also suggests a tendency towards responding well to therapeutic interventions. The absence of further details about her current mental state makes it difficult to definitively diagnose any disorder. "

        "clinical_case": "**Janna Gordon Elliott, M.D.**\n\n**Sofia Fredholm** was a 22-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis who was brought to the hospital with symptoms of respiratory distress. On the fourth day of her hospitalization, the intensive care unit called a psychiatric consultation for noncompliance with treatment. The patient was refusing nebulizer treatments and noninvasive ventilation, and was consistently found to be hypoxic and hypercarbic. The patient told the psychiatrist that she could not tolerate wearing a mask on her face for nebulizer administration or ventilation because it made her really anxious and, she said, it caused her to feel more short of breath. She had been sleeping poorly and waking frequently with breathlessness and panic. She described feeling worried that she was getting sicker the longer she stayed in the hospital and she wanted to go home. When she asked her providers for help, she reported, all they would do was ask her to put her mask back on.\n\nIn gathering a history, the consultant learned that Ms. Fredholm had grown up with her parents and two older healthy siblings in a town outside of the large city where this hospital was located. Her mother, originally from Puerto Rico, was a school nurse, and had taken on primary responsibility for Ms. Fredholm's medical care, including administering her daily pulmonary treatments. She referred to this, when Ms. Fredholm was a child, as their playtime; she would sing songs and tell her stories. As she grew up, Ms. Fredholm sometimes resisted her mother's help, telling her parents she wanted to be out like a normal kid, although she would regularly decline invitations to parties and sleepovers at the last minute and stay home, saying she was having trouble breathing. From reviewing the chart, the consultant noted an elevated carbon dioxide level, and doses of a ï¿½-agonist for bronchodilation prior to her antibiotics, which were all given by nebulizer.\n\nDuring the psychiatric interview, Ms. Fredholm was continuously adjusting her oxygen face mask, taking it off for a few minutes, and then stopping to say she was too short of breath to continue talking. She was breathing fast and appeared tremulous and distractible. She repeatedly glanced through the open door of her room and wondered aloud when her mother would be getting back from lunch in the cafeteria. She and her mother, she said, knew how to manage her symptoms better than the doctors did. At home, she was able to use her face mask or mouthpiece for saline nebulizer treatments without any problem. She also found it helpful to breathe over an herbal steam bath her mother would prepare. She was sure she would feel better in a couple of days, adding they are just making me more anxious by not listening to me.\n\nLater that night, because of rising carbon dioxide levels, Ms. Fredholm was intubated.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Sofia Fredholm's primary issue appears to be  **Personality traits or coping style affecting disorders or diseases classified elsewhere (6E40.2)**. Her anxiety and refusal of necessary treatment for cystic fibrosis significantly impact her health management."

        "clinical_case": "**Susan Samuels, M.D.**\n\n**Thomas**, an 8-year-old boy with a mild to moderate intellectual developmental disorder, was brought into the emergency room (ER) by his parents after his abdominal pain of the past several weeks had worsened over the prior 24 hours. His parents reported that he had developed **constipation**, with only one bowel movement in the past week, and that he had vomited earlier in the day. Teachers at his special education classroom for children with intellectual developmental disorders had written a report earlier in the week indicating that Thomas had been having difficulties since soon after transferring from a similar school in a different state about 4 months earlier. The teachers and parents agreed that Thomas often looked distressed, rocking, crying, and clutching his stomach.\n\nOne week earlier, a pediatrician had diagnosed an **acute exacerbation of chronic constipation**. Use of a recommended over-the-counter laxative was not helpful, and Thomas began to complain of **nighttime pain**. The discomfort led to a diminished interest in his favorite hobbies, which were video games and sports. Instead, he tended to stay in his room, playing with army men figurines that he had inherited from his grandfather's collection. Aside from episodes of irritability and tearfulness, he was generally doing well in school, both in the classroom and on the playground. When not complaining of stomachaches, Thomas ate well and maintained his position at about the 40th percentile for height and weight on the growth curve.\n\nThomas's past medical history was significant for **constipation and stomachaches**, as well as for intermittent headaches. All of these symptoms had worsened several months earlier, after the family moved from a house in semirural Florida into an old walk-up apartment in a large urban city in a different state. He shared a room with his younger brother (age 6 years), the product of a normal, unexpected pregnancy, who was enrolled in a regular education class at the local public school. Thomas said his brother was his best friend. Thomas was adopted at birth, and nothing was known of his biological parents except that they were teenagers unable to care for the child.\n\nOn medical examination in the ER, Thomas was a well-groomed boy sitting on his mother's lap. He was **crying and irritable** and refused to speak to the examiner. Instead, he would repeat to his parents that his stomach hurt. On physical examination, he was afebrile and had stable vital signs. His physical examination was remarkable only for general abdominal tenderness, although he was difficult to assess because he cried uncontrollably through most of the exam.\n\nAn abdominal X ray revealed **multiple small metallic particles** throughout the gastrointestinal tract, initially suspected to be ingested high-lead paint flakes, as well as **three 2-centimeter-long metallic objects** in his stomach. A blood lead level was **20 ï¿½g/dL** (whereas normal level for children is < 5 ï¿½g/dL). More specific questioning revealed that Thomas, being constipated, often spent long stretches on the toilet by himself. His parents added that although the bathroom was in the process of being renovated, its paint was old and peeling. Consultants decided that the larger foreign bodies in the stomach might not safely pass and could be accounting for the constipation. **Endoscopy successfully extricated three antique toy soldiers from Thomas's stomach.**",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Thomas's symptoms do not align with any of the listed ICD-11 diagnoses.  His primary issue appears to be abdominal pain and constipation, potentially exacerbated by stress related to moving and school changes. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause of his discomfort."

Freidl, M.D.**\n**Evelyn Attia, M.D.**\n\n**Uma, an 11-year-old girl in a gifted and talented school, was referred to an eating disorder specialist by a child psychiatrist** who was concerned that Uma had drifted below the 10th percentile for weight. The psychiatrist had been treating Uma for perfectionistic traits that caused her significant anxiety. Their sessions focused on anxiety, not on eating behavior.\n\n**Uma's eating difficulties started at age 9, when she began refusing to eat and reporting a fear that she would vomit.** At that time, her parents sought treatment from a pediatrician, who continued to evaluate her yearly, explaining that it was normal for children to go through phases. At age 9, Uma was above the 25th percentile for both height and weight (52 inches, 58 pounds), but by age 11, she had essentially stopped growing and had dropped to the 5th percentile on her growth curves (52.5 inches, 55 pounds).\n\n**The only child of two professional parents who had divorced 5 years earlier, Uma lived with her mother on weekdays and with her nearby father on weekends.** Her medical history was significant for her premature birth at 34 weeks' gestation. She was slow to achieve her initial milestones but by age 2 was developmentally normal. Yearly physical examinations had been unremarkable with the exception of the recent decline of her growth trajectory. Uma had always been petite, but her height and weight had never fallen below the 25th percentile for stature and weight for age on the growth chart. Uma was a talented student who was well liked by her teachers. She had never had more than a few friends, but recently she had stopped socializing entirely and had been coming directly home after school, reporting that her stomach felt calmer when she was in her own home.\n\n**For the prior 2 years, Uma had eaten only very small amounts of food over very long durations of time.** Her parents had tried to pique her interest by experimenting with foods from different cultures and of different colors and textures. None of this seemed effective in improving her appetite. They also tried to let her pick restaurants to try, but Uma had gradually refused to eat outside of either parent's home. Both parents reported a similar mealtime pattern: Uma would agree to sit at the table but then spent her time rearranging food on her plate, cutting food items into small pieces, and crying if urged to eat another bite.\n\n**When asked more about her fear of vomiting, Uma remembered one incident, at age 4, when she ate soup and her stomach became upset and then she subsequently vomited.** More recently, Uma had developed fear of eating in public and ate no food during the school day. She denied any concerns about her appearance and said that she had first become aware of her low weight at her most recent visit to the pediatrician. When educated about the dangers of low body weight, Uma became tearful and expressed a clear desire to gain weight.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Uma's symptoms align with **Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)**.  Her fear of vomiting, limited food intake, and avoidance of eating in public suggest ARFID rather than a mood disorder like Bipolar II. There is no mention of speech or language difficulties to support a secondary syndrome diagnosis."

Becker, M.D., Ph.D.**\n\n**Valerie Gaspard** was a 20-year-old single woman who had recently immigrated to the United States from West Africa with her family to do missionary work. She presented to her primary care physician complaining of **frequent headaches and chronic fatigue**. Her physical examination was unremarkable except that her **weight was only 78 pounds** and her **height was 5 feet 1 inch**, resulting in a **body mass index (BMI) of 14.7 kg/m2**. Ms. Gaspard also reported having **missed two menstrual periods in the past 6 months**. Unable to find a medical explanation for Ms. Gaspard's symptoms and concerned about her extremely low weight, the physician referred Ms. Gaspard to the hospital eating disorders program.\n\nOn presentation for psychiatric evaluation, Ms. Gaspard was **cooperative and pleasant**. She expressed concern about her low weight and denied fear of weight gain or body image disturbance: “I know I need to gain weight. I'm too skinny,” she said. Ms. Gaspard reported that she had weighed 98 pounds prior to moving to the United States 1 year earlier and said she felt embarrassed when her family members and even strangers told her she had grown too thin. Notably, everyone else in her U.S.-dwelling extended family was either of normal weight or overweight.\n\nDespite her stated motivation to be at a healthy weight, Ms. Gaspard's dietary recall revealed that she was **consuming only 600 calories per day**. The day before the evaluation, for example, she had eaten only a small bowl of macaroni pasta, a plate of steamed broccoli, and a cup of black beans. Her fluid intake was also quite limited, typically consisting of only two or three glasses of water daily.\n\nMs. Gaspard provided multiple reasons for her poor intake. The first was **lack of appetite**: “My brain doesn't even signal that I'm hungry,” she said. “I have no desire to eat throughout the whole day.” The second was **postprandial bloating and nausea**: “I just feel so uncomfortable after eating.” The third was the **limited choice of foods permitted by her religion**, which advocates a vegetarian diet. “My body is not really my own. It is a temple of God,” she explained. The fourth reason was that her preferred sources of vegetarian protein (e.g., tofu, processed meat substitutes) were not affordable within her limited household budget. Ms. Gaspard had not completed high school and had a minimum-wage position, working part-time at a clerical job at her church.\n\nMs. Gaspard denied any other symptoms of disordered eating, including binge eating, purging, or other behaviors intended to promote weight loss. However, in regard to exercise, she reported that she **walked for approximately 3-4 hours per day**. She denied that her activity was motivated by a desire to burn calories. Instead, Ms. Gaspard stated that because she did not have a car and disliked waiting for the bus, she traveled on foot to all work and leisure activities.\n\nMs. Gaspard reported no other notable psychiatric symptoms apart from the history of inadequate food intake and excessive physical activity. She appeared euthymic and did not report any symptoms of depression. She denied using alcohol or illicit drugs. She noted that her concentration was poor but expressed hope that a herbal supplement she had just begun taking would improve her memory. When queried about past treatment history, she reported that she had briefly seen a dietitian about 6 months earlier when her family began nagging her about her low weight, but she had not viewed the meetings as helpful.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Ms. Gaspard's symptoms most closely align with  **Eating disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS)**.  Her extremely low weight, severe calorie restriction, and denial of fear of weight gain despite acknowledging her need to gain weight are consistent with this diagnosis. While she does not meet the full criteria for anorexia nervosa, her case warrants further evaluation by a specialist."

She said she felt **sad, worthless, and lonely**. She reported that she needed to improve her diet and exercise but felt out of control. She added that she had gone to her internist several times in recent months for stomachaches, and he finally insisted that she see a psychiatrist.\n\nMs. Hoffman had been living alone since her college graduation 2 years earlier. She had recently been promoted in her job as an accountant, and said that she enjoyed her work. She mentioned having some friends from high school and being interested in dating, but she felt **too tired and sad** to do much besides meet up for a quick dinner after work. She was unable to exercise because of low energy, slept poorly, and frequently had stomachaches. These symptoms and the resulting social dysfunction had caused her to feel increasingly **isolated, lonely, and sad**. She often found herself feeling worthless and wondering how she was going to get through the week, but she denied suicidal intent or plan.\n\nShe said she had accepted the psychiatric referral so that she could get an antidepressant medication, but it had to be one that didn't cause weight gain. Hopefully, I could get one that would cause weight loss, instead. Ms. Hoffman added that she couldn't get back to her ideal weight despite lots of effort. When asked about the effort, Ms. Hoffman grew quiet but did eventually answer: I wasn't going to talk about this, but I'm a '**failed anorexic**.' I can diet for about half a day, but by dinner, I'm starving, so I eat everything I can find, and then I throw up. It's mortifying.\n\nMs. Hoffman reported that she had started dieting at about age 13; she noted that, in retrospect, she was being ridiculous, and that her weight had been fine. She said her downfall really began when she started stress eating in college. When she realized she had gained 10 or 15 pounds, she began to routinely skip breakfast. She often skipped lunch as well, but then, famished, she would overeat in the late afternoon and evening.\n\nBy the end of her sophomore year, Ms. Hoffman had started **inducing vomiting**, a practice she learned about in a magazine. She had developed her current eating pattern during her junior year and continued it after graduation: no breakfast; a light lunch; an average dinner, often with friends; and then she'd rush back to her apartment for a second dinner and a pint or two of ice cream, followed by **self-induced vomiting**.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Wanda Hoffman exhibits symptoms consistent with a current depressive episode with melancholia (6A80.3).  She displays anhedonia, diminished emotional reactivity, sleep disturbances, and psychomotor retardation.

She had responded well to a combination of psychotherapy and medications (fluoxetine and bupropion), but she began to complain of weight gain. She was at her highest weight ever, which was 140 pounds (her height was 5 feet 5 inches, so her BMI was 23.3).\n\n**The psychiatrist** embarked on a clarification of Ms. Isherwood's eating history, which was marked by recurrent, distressing episodes of uncontrollable eating of large amounts of food. The overeating was not new but seemed to have worsened while she was taking antidepressants. She reported that she often worked late in her job as marketing director for a large software company, and that the eating episodes often occurred on one of 2 days per week that she happened to get home before her husband, a cardiologist at a local hospital. These eating jags were notable for a sense that she was out of control.\n\n**She ate rapidly and alone**, until uncomfortably full. She would then feel depressed, tired, and disgusted with herself. She usually binged on healthy food but also had sugar binges where she ate primarily sweets, especially ice cream and candy. She denied current or past self-induced vomiting, fasting, or misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or weight-loss agents. She reported exercising for an hour almost every day but denied being addicted to it. She did report that in her late 20s, she had become a competitive runner. At that time, she ran an average of about 35 miles per week, despite a lingering foot injury that eventually forced her to shift to swimming, biking, and the elliptical machine.\n\n**Ms. Isherwood stated** that she had binged on food for as long as I can remember. She was chunky as a child but stayed at a normal weight throughout high school (120-125 pounds) because she was so active. She denied a history of anorexia nervosa. At age 28, when she was competitively running, she reached her lowest adult weight of 113 pounds. At that point, she felt vital, healthy, and in control.\n\n**In her mid-30s**, she had a major depressive episode that lasted 2 years. She had a severely depressed mood, did not talk, closed down, stayed in bed, was very fatigued, slept more than usual, and was unable to function. This was one of the few times in her life that the binge eating stopped and she lost weight. She denied a history of hypomanic or manic episodes. Although she lived with frequent sadness, she denied other serious depressive episodes until the past year. She denied a history of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and any significant use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit substances.\n\n**The evaluation revealed** a well-nourished, well-developed female who was coherent and cooperative. Her speech was fluent and not pressured. She had a mildly depressed mood but had a reactive affect with appropriate smiles. She denied guilt, suicidality, and hopelessness. She said her energy was normal except for post-binge fatigue. She denied psychosis and confusion. Her cognition was normal. Her medical history was unremarkable, and physical examination and basic laboratory test results provided by her internist were within normal limits.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Yasmine Isherwood's symptoms point towards  **Binge Eating Disorder**.  She experiences recurrent episodes of uncontrolled overeating, feelings of distress and guilt afterward, and attempts to compensate through exercise. Her history of dieting and emotional connection with food also support this diagnosis."

Rubin, M.D.**\n\nZack was an **8-year-old boy** brought to the outpatient child psychiatry clinic by his mother because of increasing **tantrums and somatic complaints** without an apparent cause. The mother reported that the symptoms appeared related to the nights that he spent with his **aunt**, another **single mom** with a boy similar in age to Zack. He had been **close to this aunt since birth** but had only recently begun to spend every **Friday night** with her when the mother took on a **night shift at work**.\n\nFor **2 months prior to the consultation**, Zack would report **nausea and headaches on Fridays** and complain that his aunt's house was **creepy**. He continued to visit, with reluctance, although he did once call his mother at work demanding that she pick him up, saying, **\"Other kids live in their own home every day of the week.\"** In recent weeks, Zack screamed and hid when it came time to go to his aunt's home. His mother became concerned that something could have happened to Zack during a visit.\n\nThe mother struggled to reconcile this with the fact that Zack had **no objections to seeing the aunt and cousin anywhere else**, and he had **no objection to the cousin sleeping at their home**. Her sister had always been a good mom and was always home during the sleepovers. She did have a boyfriend, but Zack seemed to like him. In fact, Zack seemed especially excited to go to the park or ball games with his cousin and the boyfriend.\n\nZack had never previously had particularly significant **separation, behavioral, or emotional issues**. He achieved all **developmental milestones on time**. He had never seen a doctor aside from routine visits and one bad cold when he was age 3. Zack had yet to achieve consistent **overnight continence**, however, and did wet the bed approximately **twice weekly**. He had **no daytime voiding symptoms or constipation**. The pediatrician had told them that this was normal at Zack's age. The mother had never made a big deal about the bed-wetting, and Zack had never expressed significant distress about it.\n\n**Family history** was negative for all **psychiatric illness** on the mother's side, and the mother said her own **developmental landmarks** were normal as far as she had been told. The mother knew little about Zack's father's developmental or family history, and she had not seen him since before Zack was born.\n\nOn **mental status examination**, Zack was **cooperative** and appeared **well-nourished and well-cared for**. He had little difficulty separating from his mother. After an initial period of warming up to the interviewer, his speech was **spontaneous** with a vocabulary appropriate for his age. He maintained **age-appropriate eye contact**. His affect was initially **mildly anxious**, but he rapidly calmed. **Anxiety** only reappeared upon discussing his sleepovers, when Zack demonstrated some **fidgeting, decreased eye contact**, and **mild irritability directed toward his mother**. When asked about the bed-wetting, Zack appeared **embarrassed**. He said he had **wet the bed at his aunt's house a few times** and that both his cousin and his aunt's boyfriend **teased him about it**. His aunt had intervened, but he described being scared that he would do it again.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Zack's symptoms of anxiety and fear related specifically to sleepovers at his aunt's house suggest a possible separation anxiety disorder.  His distress appears linked to the situation rather than generalized anxieties about his body or senses.  Additional information would be needed for a definitive diagnosis."

        "clinical_case": "**Charles F. Reynolds, M.D.**\n\n**Aidan Johns**, a 30-year-old graduate student in English, visited a psychiatrist to discuss his difficulty staying asleep. The trouble began 4 months earlier, when he started to wake up at 3:00 every morning, no matter when he went to bed, and then was unable to fall back to sleep. As a result, he felt out of it during the day. This led him to feel increasingly worried about how he was going to finish his doctoral dissertation when he was unable to concentrate owing to exhaustion. When his sleep difficulties began, he woke with nothing particular on his mind. As the trouble persisted, he found himself dreading the upcoming day and wondering how he would teach his classes or focus on his writing if he was getting only a few hours of sleep. Some mornings he lay awake in the dark next to his fiancée, who was sleeping soundly. On other mornings he would cut his losses, rise from bed, and go very early to his office on campus.\n\nAfter a month of interrupted sleep, Mr. Johns visited a physician's assistant at the university's student health services, where he customarily got his medical care. (He suffered from asthma, for which he occasionally took inhaled β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, and a year earlier he had had mononucleosis.) The physician's assistant prescribed a sedative-hypnotic, which did not help. Falling asleep was never the problem, Mr. Johns explained. Meanwhile, he heeded some of the advice he read online. Although he felt reliant on coffee during the day, he never drank it after 2:00 p.m. An avid tennis player, he restricted his court time to the early morning. He did have a glass or two of wine every night at dinner with his fiancée, however. \"By dinnertime I start to worry about whether I'll be able to sleep,\" he said, \"and, to be honest, the wine helps.\"\n\n**The patient**, a slender and fit-appearing young man looking very much the part of the young academic in a tweed jacket and tortoise-rimmed glasses, was pleasant and open in his storytelling. Mr. Johns did not appear tired but told the evaluating psychiatrist, \"I made a point to see you in the morning, before I hit the wall.\" He did not look sad or on edge and was not sure if he had ever felt depressed. But he was certain of the nagging, low-level anxiety that was currently oppressing him. \"This sleep problem has taken over,\" he explained. \"I'm stressed about my work, and my fiancée and I have been arguing. But it's all because I'm so tired.\"\n\nAlthough this was his first visit to a psychiatrist, Mr. Johns spoke of a fulfilling 3-year psychodynamic psychotherapy with a social worker while in college. \"I was just looking to understand myself better,\" he explained, adding with a chuckle that as the son of a child psychiatrist, he was accustomed to people assuming he was crazy. He recalled always being an easy sleeper prior to his recent difficulties; as a child he was the first to fall asleep at slumber parties, and as an adult he inspired the envy of his fiancée for the ease with which he could doze off on an airplane.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Aidan Johns's primary issue appears to be insomnia.  While he experiences anxiety and stress related to his sleep difficulties, the core symptom is his inability to fall back asleep after waking at 3:00 am.  This suggests a diagnosis of Insomnia Disorder according to ICD-11 criteria."

Ohayon, M.D., D.Sc., Ph.D.**\n\n**Bernadette Kleber**, a 34-year-old divorced, unemployed white mother of three school-age children, living with a new companion, presented to a psychiatrist for anxiety and sleepiness.\n\n**Anxiety:** Ms. Kleber had experienced anxiety much of her life, becoming more worried and stressed since the birth of her first child 10 years prior.  She felt okay at home but anxious in social situations, avoiding interaction with new people due to fear of embarrassment and judgment.  For example, she wanted to lose weight (current BMI 27.7) but feared ridicule at the gym.  This avoidance made job interviews and work nearly impossible.  She had been successfully treated for social anxiety disorder 5 years earlier with psychotherapy, an SSRI antidepressant, and clonazepam 0.25 mg twice daily, but symptoms returned over the past year. She denied increasing medication doses or taking other anxiety medications.  Although excited about her new relationship, she worried her girlfriend would leave her if she didn't \"tune up my act.\" She denied significant depression, though she felt frustrated with her limited effectiveness, and denied all manic symptoms.\n\n**Sleepiness:**  Ms. Kleber reported sleeping more than anyone she knew, typically at least 9 hours per night, plus two naps for 5 additional hours daily.  The problem began at the end of high school, with her falling asleep around 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. and dozing every afternoon.  She dropped out of college due to excessive sleepiness. Despite naps, she often fell asleep socializing, reading, or watching TV, and quit driving alone for fear of falling asleep at the wheel. Late afternoon naps were not restorative and didn't affect nighttime sleep.\n\n**Daily Life Impact:** Raising a family was difficult, especially mornings, as she was disoriented and confused for at least half an hour after waking, making it hard to get her children to school.  Throughout the day, she felt scattered and inattentive.\n\n**Other Symptoms:** Snoring appeared 5 years prior. Her companion was unsure about breathing pauses during sleep. Ms. Kleber denied sleep paralysis or abruptly falling asleep mid-sentence.  Falling asleep while socializing usually occurred during lulls in conversation in quiet corners. She denied falling down when falling asleep and reported hypnopompic hallucinations several times per year since her teens.\n\n**Examination and History:** On examination, Ms. Kleber was an overweight, cooperative, and coherent woman, concerned about her anxiety but preoccupied with her sleep problem. She denied depression, suicidality, psychosis, and memory complaints. Her insight and judgment appeared intact.  Her physical examination was essentially noncontributory. Her medical history included hypercholesterolemia and occasional migraines.  She had muscular complaints, like leg weakness and left arm pain, related to exertion, and occasionally used marijuana for pain, denying it significantly contributed to her sleepiness. She denied head trauma, unusual illnesses, and a family history of sleep or mood problems, though multiple relatives were anxious.\n\n**Diagnostic Testing:** Ms. Kleber was referred for sleep studies. Polysomnography showed an apnea hypopnea index of 3 events per hour.  A multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) indicated a mean sleep latency of 7 minutes with one sleep-onset REM period. A lumbar puncture to assess CSF hypocretin-1 levels showed normal results.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Bernadette Kleber's primary diagnosis appears to be a hypersomnolence disorder. Her excessive sleepiness, daytime napping, and difficulty staying awake despite long sleep durations are consistent with this diagnosis.  Her social anxiety is likely related to her hypersomnia but does not appear to be the primary concern. "

Kapur, M.D., M.P.H.**\n\n**César Linares**, a 57-year-old married Hispanic man, presented for reevaluation of his antidepressant medication. He described several years of worsening **fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and generally not feeling good**. He lacked the energy to do his usual activities, but he still enjoyed them when he did participate. He had been having some trouble focusing on his work as an information technology consultant and was worried that he would lose his job. A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant had been started 6 months earlier, resulting in some improvement of symptoms, and Mr. Linares reported that he was adherent to this medication.\n\nHe denied recent stressors. In addition to having been diagnosed with **depression**, he had received diagnoses of **hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease**. He complained of **heartburn** as well as **erectile dysfunction**, for which he had not been medically evaluated.\n\nMr. Linares was born in Venezuela. He had two grown children. He did not consume tobacco or alcohol but did drink several servings of coffee each day to help maintain alertness.\n\nOn physical examination, the patient was 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighed 235 pounds, and had a BMI of 34. His neck circumference was 20 inches. His respiratory rate was 15, and his blood pressure was 155/90. No other abnormalities were present.\n\nOn mental status examination, the patient was a cooperative man who appeared tired but was without depressed mood, anxiety, psychosis, or cognitive decline.\n\nMore focused questioning revealed that Mr. Linares not only had trouble staying awake at work but also occasionally nodded off while driving. He slept 8-10 hours nightly but had **frequent awakenings, made nightly trips to the bathroom (nocturia), and often woke with a choking sensation and sometimes with a headache**. He had snored since childhood, and he added, \"All the men in my family are snorers.\" Before she elected to sleep nightly in their guest bedroom, his wife said he snored very loudly and intermittently stopped breathing and gasped for air.\n\nMr. Linares was referred for a sleep study (polysomnography). Results included the following:\n*   **Apnea hypopnea index: 25 events per hour**\n*   **Oxygen desaturation index: 20 events per hour**\n*   **Nadir oxygen saturation: 82%**\n*   **% Time with oxygen saturation < 90%: 10%**\n*   **Arousal index: 35 events per hour**\n*   **Sleep stage (%):**\n    *   % Time in stage N1 sleep: 20%\n    *   % Time in stage N2 sleep: 65%\n    *   % Time in stage N3 sleep: 5%\n    *   % Time in REM sleep: 10%",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Linares' symptoms of fatigue, daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating, and snoring with pauses in breathing point to Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).  His polysomnography results confirm this diagnosis with an apnea hypopnea index of 25 events per hour and a nadir oxygen saturation of 82%. He should be referred for treatment of OSA."

Parker, Ph.D., R.N.**\n\n**Dingxiang Meng** was a 63-year-old Chinese-born man who was referred for a psychiatric consultation for **depression and excessive somatic complaints**. He had a history of **psychotic depression**, for which he had been admitted twice in the prior decade. He was evaluated as an outpatient in the renal unit of a small hospital during his routine hemodialysis.\n\n**Mr. Meng** had been diagnosed with **diabetes** soon after his immigration to the United States 15 years earlier. He developed progressive renal insufficiency and had begun hemodialysis 7 years earlier. He was divorced, with two adult children and three young grandchildren. He currently lived with one of his children. Before starting on dialysis, Mr. Meng had worked episodically in a local grocery store owned by friends. Prior to emigrating from China, he had enjoyed a career as a pharmacist. He spoke little English; all interviews were conducted with a Mandarin interpreter.\n\nAt the time of the evaluation, Mr. Meng said he felt **itchy, creepy, and crawly, like worms were crawling underneath his skin**. These symptoms had fluctuated over the past few years but had worsened in recent weeks, and he felt like he was going crazy. He described being worried and often tired, but noted that he always cheered up when playing with his grandchildren or when visiting with old friends from his hometown. He did not display a thought disorder. A review of the chart indicated that Mr. Meng's physical complaints had been conceptualized at various times as **akathisia, peripheral neuropathy, and psychosomatic and psychotically ruminative symptoms**. He had been euthymic and off all psychiatric medications for 2 years at the time of this evaluation.\n\n**Mr. Meng** noted that his physical symptoms were worse at night, when he tried to sit still or lie down. The discomfort was only in his legs. Rubbing them helped, but the greatest relief came from standing up and pacing. Dialysis was especially difficult because of being strapped to a machine for hours. He also complained of daytime sleepiness and fatigue. In the course of the interview, Mr. Meng twice jumped up during the dialysis.\n\nOne of the nurses mentioned that he often asked them to cut short his dialysis, generally looked tired, and always seemed to be jumping around. The staff wondered whether he might be nonadherent to his medications as well as being uncooperative at times during the dialysis.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Meng's symptoms of feeling 'itchy, creepy, and crawly' with a belief that 'worms were crawling underneath his skin' align with body dysmorphic disorder.  His lack of insight into these sensations and insistence they are real suggests poor to absent insight (6B21.1). It is important to note that this is an assessment based on limited information, and a comprehensive diagnosis requires a thorough evaluation by a qualified healthcare professional."

Graham, Ph.D.**\n\nElizabeth Olsen and **Finn Nelson** presented for **couples counseling** in the context of increased arguments prior to their upcoming wedding. They were both successful **attorneys in their late 30s**. They had known each other since high school, had been dating for about **2 years**, and planned to get married in about **6 months**. Both denied ever having previously seen a therapist or received a **psychiatric diagnosis**.\n\nThe couples therapist met with them together for one session. Both **Ms. Olsen** and **Mr. Nelson** reported being **very much in love** and wanting the marriage to work out, but they also said that they were **fighting much of the time**. Ms. Olsen said she admired Mr. Nelson's **intelligence and steadiness** and did not know why they fought. He, on the other hand, said he was still totally infatuated but upset about **Ms. Olsen's overall lack of interest in him**. As the session neared a close, Mr. Nelson asked Ms. Olsen whether she wanted to bring up the schedule, the alcohol, or the sex thing, at which she smiled and said, **\"I'm afraid we're out of time for today.\"**\n\nThe therapist met with each of them separately. At his meeting, **Mr. Nelson** said his biggest concern with Ms. Olsen was her **lack of interest in sex**. She seemed to go through the motions, he said, and always relied on alcohol. He worried that he was a **7 trying to date a 10** and that she just did not find him attractive. He was distressed about the fact that, try as he might, he was unable to bring her to **orgasm** or even to get her significantly aroused. This was, in turn, leading him to initiate sex **less frequently**, and even when he tried, he would often just give up half-way through. He had brought it up with her several times, but she had insisted that there was **no problem**. The therapist asked what he had meant by the **schedule thing**. He explained that since they had begun dating, she had limited their time together to **one school night**, usually a Tuesday, and then either a **Friday or Saturday night**. She had insisted that the schedule was necessary for her to complete her work and see her best girlfriends, but he had increasingly come to believe it was **to avoid him**.\n\nIn her individual session, **Ms. Olsen** said she was most frustrated by Mr. Nelson's **intensity and high desire for sex**. She had set up their **weekly schedule** because otherwise he would want to constantly have sex with her. As it was, he wanted sex **every time they got together**, often **twice in the same night**. She readily admitted that she got **drunk to tolerate intercourse**. She added that she had used alcohol to numb herself since she began dating while in her teens. Until she had started dating Mr. Nelson, most of her **sexual experiences had been while drunk with strangers**. She had had a couple of boyfriends, but one was secretly gay and the other was happy to get a blow job every now and then. She had not told Mr. Nelson about these **misadventures** because she preferred that he continue to see her as the **near-virginal beauty queen**. Although alcohol made intercourse acceptable, **sexual arousal was almost never tolerable** and made her want to pass out. In recent months, Mr. Nelson had increasingly forced the **orgasm issue**. In the past, she would simply have **broken up with any boyfriend** who acted that way, but she believed she needed to stick it out because she was nearing 40 and this would be her **last chance to have a baby**. When asked why she thought she had these issues with sex, Ms. Olsen looked out the window for almost a minute and then answered, **\"I'm not going to tell you.\"**",

The case describes relationship issues and Ms. Olsen's reluctance to engage in sexual activity, but no clear delusional beliefs are presented.

At the time of his presentation, he had not taken any antidepressant medication since the trial with sertraline (about a month earlier).\n\nThe evaluation revealed a **severely depressed man** with **profound psychomotor retardation, poor concentration, early insomnia, mildly diminished libido, and anhedonia**. Mr. Palmer denied a substance use disorder, drank minimally, and did not smoke. He had started taking **propranolol** for hypertension about 6 months previously. His physical examination was unremarkable. Basic laboratory tests were within normal limits. His blood pressure was 135/85.\n\nTreatment with **clomipramine** was initiated and was quickly increased, as tolerated, to the recommended maximum dosage of 250 mg/day. **Buspirone** 30 mg/day was added.

He was sleeping and eating well, was participating in enjoyable activities with increasing enthusiasm, and, for the first time in many months, felt a return of his sexual interest.\n\nAfter not having had sexual intercourse in months, Mr. Palmer tried unsuccessfully to have sex several times. He was distressed to find that for the first time in his life, he was **unable to maintain an erection during intercourse and was unable to ejaculate, even during masturbation**.

She had generally preferred the company of girls throughout childhood. During her teen years, she continued to have many female friends but considered herself a gay male and dated a few other gay teens. She recalled trying her best to fit in but noted that she had always felt like an outsider.\n\n**At age 19, during a romantic relationship with a man, she become aware of an intense desire to be a woman.** That relationship ended, but Ms. Rohmer's desire to be a woman evolved into a strong sense that she had been born as the wrong gender. She tried to figure out whether this sense had existed earlier, but all she could recall was occasionally wishing she were a girl to fit in more comfortably with her friends.\n\n**By age 20, Ms. Rohmer was very unhappy about being seen as a man.** She viewed her genitalia as repugnant and a mistake of nature. Her family and some of her friends had not supported her developing sense of herself, and she recalled feeling increasingly hopeless, with episodic suicidal ideation and one nonlethal suicide attempt by overdose at age 21.\n\n**Beginning at age 22, Ms. Rohmer lived as a female, including changing her name and exclusively wearing women's clothes.** She struggled to access appropriate health services and encountered multiple barriers to obtaining appropriate treatments, but, at the age of 24, Ms. Rohmer was evaluated by two psychiatrists skilled in transgender health, who agreed with her perspective, and she started gender-affirming hormone therapy.\n\n**As her transition progressed, she began to feel more comfortable in the female role and pleased with having secondary sexual characteristics that were more consistent with her experienced gender.** She explored her sexuality during this time, dating both gay and straight men. Her anxiety diminished, although, as a member of a disenfranchised subgroup, she felt vulnerable to various types of aggression, including potential partner violence.\n\n**The following year, at age 25, Ms. Rohmer had the gender on her driver's license and passport changed from male to female (a change of gender markers) and underwent gender-affirming surgeries that included vaginoplasty and breast augmentation.** The results of these surgeries were satisfactory, and she was often happy with the transition. She described herself as being more comfortable in her skin than she had ever been, and she only infrequently felt hopeless and suicidal. Despite not feeling particularly accepted by her family of origin or by some of her old friends, she found warm support from other friends and colleagues at work. Although she has many friends who are gender nonbinary/gender nonconforming, Ms. Rohmer identifies as a heterosexual female.\n\n**She said she tended to worry that people were judging her negatively, but this worry was less intense now than it had been earlier in her transition.** She denied any recent suicide attempts, depression, or self-injurious behavior. She said she had almost given up on having a successful relationship but was somehow still optimistic that something would work out.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Ms. Rohmer's presentation aligns with  a diagnosis of **Gender Dysphoria** (6A00 according to ICD-11).  Her distress stems from a marked incongruence between her gender identity as female and the sex she was assigned at birth. This is supported by her history of dysphoria, social challenges, and the positive impact of gender-affirming treatments."

His mother said she was exhausted, adding that it was hard to raise a boy who doesn't know the rules.\n\nBeginning as a young child, Kyle was unusually aggressive, bullying other children and taking their things. When confronted by his mother, stepfather, or a teacher, he had long tended to curse, punch, and show no concern for possible punishment. Disruptive, impulsive, and fidgety, Kyle was diagnosed with **attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)** and placed in a special education program by second grade. He began to see a psychiatrist in fourth grade for weekly psychotherapy and medications (quetiapine and dexmethylphenidate). He was adherent only sporadically with both the medication and the therapy. When asked why this was, he replied that his psychiatrist was stupid.\n\nDuring the year prior to the admission, he had been caught stealing from school lockers (a cell phone, a jacket, a laptop computer), disciplined after mugging a classmate for his wallet, and suspended after multiple physical fights with classmates. He had been arrested twice for these behaviors. His mother and teachers agreed that although he could be charming to strangers, people quickly caught on to the fact that he was a con artist. Kyle was consistently unremorseful, externalizing of blame, and uninterested in the feelings of others. He was disorganized, was inattentive and uninterested in following instructions, and constantly lost his possessions. He generally did not do his homework, and when he did, his performance was erratic. When confronted about his poor performance, he tended to say, And what are you going to do, shoot me? Kyle, his mother, and his teachers agreed that he was a loner and not well liked by his peers.\n\nKyle lived with his mother, stepfather, and two younger half-siblings. His stepfather was unemployed, and his mother worked part-time as a cashier in a grocery store. His biological father was in prison for drug possession. Both biological grandfathers had a history of alcohol use disorder.\n\nKyle's early history was normal. The pregnancy was uneventful, and he reached all of his milestones on time. There was no history of sexual or physical abuse. Kyle had no known medical problems, alcohol or substance abuse, or participation in gang activities. He had not been caught with weapons, had not set fires, and had not been seen as particularly cruel to other children or animals. He had been regularly truant from school but had neither run away nor stayed away from home until late at night.\n\nWhen interviewed on the psychiatric unit, Kyle was casually groomed and appeared his stated age of 12. He was fidgety and made sporadic eye contact with the interviewer. He said he was mad and insisted he would rather be in jail than on a psychiatric unit. His speech was loud but coherent, goal directed, and of normal rate. His affect was irritable and angry. He denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. He denied psychotic symptoms. He denied feeling depressed. He had no obvious cognitive deficits but declined more formal testing. His insight was limited, and his judgment was poor by history.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the information provided, Kyle's symptoms align with Conduct Disorder (312.0) from the ICD-11.  His history of aggression, rule-breaking, lack of remorse, and disregard for others' feelings are key indicators. His impulsivity and difficulty following instructions also point towards this diagnosis."

Terrified, she ran out of the kitchen, gathered up the toddlers, and left for her mother's house a few miles away. The next day, she told her husband that he would need to get help immediately or prepare for a divorce.\n\n**Mr. Sandahl said his blowups began in childhood but did not become problematic for him until age 13.** At about that time, he started having frequent fights with classmates that would occasionally result in trips to the principal's office. In between the altercations, he was active socially and a solid student.\n\n**Mr. Sandahl estimated that he had had approximately four verbal outbursts a week in recent years,** generally in response to frustration, unexpected demands, or perceived insults. In addition to these heated verbal tussles, Mr. Sandahl described acts of violence about every 2 months; for example, he threw a computer monitor across the room when it started acting up, he kicked a hole in a wall when one of his children would not quit crying, and he destroyed his mobile phone during an argument with his mother. He denied physical fights since his adolescence, although he had nearly come to blows with a neighbor as well as an assortment of strangers and employees. The idea that he might physically hurt someone scared Mr. Sandahl to the core.\n\n**These outbursts blighted his relationships with colleagues and romantic partners** and led to his decision to start his own landscaping company at age 25. The business had done well, despite his demanding style and hair-trigger temper that led to high employee turnover.\n\n**Mr. Sandahl described the episodes as short-lived,** reaching a peak within seconds and rarely lasting more than a few minutes. Between episodes, he described himself as feeling fine. He had experienced brief periods of depressed mood and increased anxiety, but these had not impaired him significantly and tended to resolve on their own within a week. Mr. Sandahl drank socially, but neither he nor his wife linked the outbursts to the alcohol. He had a history of experimentation with various drugs of abuse, but not in recent years.\n\n**Mr. Sandahl reported at least two other immediate family members with significant anger issues.** His father was emotionally abusive and perfectionistic, expecting great things from his only son. Mr. Sandahl's older sister also had problems with her temper; he attributed her three divorces to her emotionally abusive behavior.\n\n**On examination, Mr. Sandahl was casually dressed, cooperative, and coherent.** He was worried about his behavior and contrite toward his wife. He denied depression, psychosis, and confusion. He denied any thoughts of hurting himself or others. He was cognitively intact. His insight and judgment were good during the course of the interview.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on Mr. Sandahl's history of frequent, intense anger outbursts with both verbal and physical aggression, a diagnosis of Intermittent Explosive Disorder (ICD-11 code: 6B43) would be appropriate.  His outbursts are triggered by perceived insults, frustrations, or demands, causing significant distress and impairment in his personal and professional life. His pattern of behavior since childhood aligns with the criteria for this disorder."

        "clinical_case": "**Marc A. Schuckit, M.D.**\n\n**Matthew Tucker, a 45-year-old married European American plumber**, was referred for a psychiatric evaluation after his family carried out an intervention to express their concern that his alcohol problems were getting out of control. Mr. Tucker denied having had a drink since making the appointment 3 days earlier.\n\nFor 20 years after high school, Mr. Tucker typically drank **3-5 beers per evening, five times per week**. Over the last 7 years, he had consumed alcohol almost daily, with an average of **6 beers on weeknights and 12 beers on weekends and holidays**. His wife repeatedly voiced her concern that he was drinking too much, but despite his efforts to limit his alcohol intake, Mr. Tucker continued to spend much of the weekend drinking, sometimes missing family get-togethers, and often passed out while watching TV in the evening. He remained productive at work, however, and never called in sick. In many ways, his history represented what is typically seen in alcohol use disorder. Mr. Tucker had achieved two 30-day periods of abstinence in the previous 4 years. Both times, he said he had quit drinking cold turkey in response to his wife's concerns. He denied having had symptoms of alcohol withdrawal either time.\n\nIn the 6 months prior to the evaluation, Mr. Tucker had become uncharacteristically **irritable, fatigued, dysphoric, and worried**. He was unable to enjoy his usual activities, including food and sex, and had difficulty concentrating. He also reacted more emotionally to stresses and expressed unsubstantiated concern about the future of his business. The patient often awoke at 2:00 a.m. and had trouble getting back to sleep.\n\nMr. Tucker and his wife indicated that although this period of sadness had lasted 6 months, he had experienced several similar episodes in the prior 5 years, lasting 4-6 weeks each. They denied any such episodes earlier in his life.\n\nMr. Tucker had been married for 18 years, and he and his wife had one 17-year-old daughter. The patient was a high school graduate with 2 years of community college who currently owned a successful plumbing company. He denied any other history of psychiatric or medical problems, as well as any history of mania or suicide attempts. He had never seen a psychiatrist before.\n\nAt a recent annual checkup, Mr. Tucker's internist noted a mildly elevated blood pressure (135/92), a ?-glutamyltransferase (GGT) value of 47 IU/L, and a mean corpuscular volume of 92.5 ï¿½m3. All other laboratory results were in the normal range.\n\nAt the time of his first visit, Mr. Tucker was neatly dressed, maintained good eye contact, and showed no evidence of confusion or psychotic symptoms. His eyes teared up when he talked about the future, and he admitted to having felt sad for most of the day on a regular basis for the last 6 months, but he denied suicidal ideation or plans. His cognition was within normal limits, and he demonstrated an understanding of the effects that the alcohol was having on him.\n\nA physical examination by the psychiatrist revealed a normal pulse rate, no tremor or sweating, and only a slightly elevated blood pressure.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Tucker's symptoms align with a diagnosis of  **Alcohol Use Disorder**. He exhibits patterns of excessive alcohol consumption, dependence, and negative consequences related to his drinking.  His history of two periods of abstinence, followed by relapse, further supports this diagnosis."

Weiss, M.D.**\n\n**Nicholas Underwood**, a 41-year-old married software engineer, entered an alcohol treatment program with this chief complaint: **I need to stop drinking or my wife will divorce me.**\n\nAt the time of admission, Mr. Underwood stated that he was drinking approximately **1 liter of vodka per day, every day**, and had not had an alcohol-free day in over 2 years. For many years, Mr. Underwood had drunk alcohol only after work, but about a year prior to the evaluation he had begun to routinely drink in the morning whenever he had the day off. More recently, he had begun to feel shaky every morning and would sometimes treat that sensation with a drink, followed by more alcohol during the day.\n\n**Mr. Underwood experienced a number of problems related to drinking.** His wife was at the end of her rope and considering divorce. His diminished ability to concentrate at work was sinking his once-promising career. He was spending more time trying to recover from the effects of drinking and found himself planning strategies both for abstinence and for surreptitiously taking his next drink.\n\nMr. Underwood first tried alcohol in high school and said that he had always been able to hold his liquor more than his friends could. In college, he was one of the heaviest drinkers in a fraternity known as Animal House around campus. Through his 30s, he gradually increased the frequency of his drinking from primarily on weekends to daily.\n\nOver the prior year, he had switched from being exclusively a beer drinker to drinking vodka. He had gone to many Alcoholics Anonymous meetings over the years but tended to drink as soon as the meeting ended. He had received no formal treatment.\n\nThe patient denied recent use of other substances; he had smoked marijuana and snorted cocaine several times during college but never since. He had used no other illicit drugs and took no medications. He did not smoke cigarettes. He had experienced blackouts on several occasions during college but not since then. He had no history of seizures and no other medical problems. Family history was significant for alcohol use disorder in his father and paternal grandfather.\n\nMr. Underwood entered the alcohol treatment program at approximately 3:00 p.m., having not had a drink since the evening before. **He was diaphoretic and exhibited significant tremulousness in his hands.** He complained of anxiety, restlessness, irritability, nausea, and recent insomnia.\n\nClinical evaluation revealed a casually groomed, diaphoretic man who was cooperative but anxiously pacing and who immediately said, **I'm getting ready to jump out of my skin.** Speech was of normal rate, rhythm, and tone. He denied depression. There was no evidence of psychotic thinking, and he denied auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations. He was alert and oriented to person, place, and date. He had no gross memory deficits, but his attention and concentration were noted to be reduced.\n\n**Notable features of his physical examination were marked diaphoresis, a blood pressure of 155/95, a heart rate of 104 beats/minute, severe tremulousness in his upper extremities, and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes throughout.** Laboratory test findings were within normal limits except for aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, which were approximately 3 times normal.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Underwood's symptoms point towards Alcohol Use Disorder.  His excessive alcohol consumption, dependence, and negative consequences in his personal and professional life align with the diagnostic criteria.  He displays withdrawal symptoms upon admission, further supporting this diagnosis."

At age 35, he was independently wealthy as the owner of several clothing franchises, lived with an ex-partner in a more-than-comfortable apartment in New York City, worked out every day, enjoyed the company of a group of loving friends, and, although single, had not given up on the idea of someday (preferably soon) finding the perfect man to share his life with. \n\nMr. Vincent came out to his Irish Catholic family when he was 19. His parents had already guessed that Mr. Vincent was gay long before he told them, and they took the non-news fairly well. Their main concern had been that their son might be discriminated against because of his sexuality, get hurt, and live a lonely life. Nothing could be farther from the way things turned out: Mr. Vincent was out and proud and living it up.\n\nWhen Mr. Vincent found himself with a substance use problem, he addressed it the same way he had dealt with pretty much everything else: head on. For the first time in his life, he decided to see a psychiatrist.\n\nMr. Vincent described a pattern that revolved around weekend party and play activities. On Friday and Saturday evenings-and occasionally during the week-he would go out to dinner with friends and then to a club or a private party. He tended to drink two or three cocktails and four to five glasses of wine during the evening. \"Without the alcohol, I found I could easily say no to substances, but after a good buzz, if someone has coke-and there is always someone around who has coke-I use. And then my heart starts to race, and then I do everything I can to hook up. I used to go online, but these days, it's all on Scruff and good ol' Grindr.\"\n\n**Party and play** are classic code words for drugs and sex, respectively. The term is sometimes abbreviated **PNP**.\n\n**Scruff and Grindr** are smartphone applications that use GPS to identify and connect similarly inclined individuals in a person's geographical vicinity.\n\nOverall, Mr. Vincent drank alcohol and used cocaine three to four times a week and occasionally used Tina and bath salts. He could hardly attend Monday morning meetings, much less prepare for them, and had been trying to cut down on his cocaine use for the prior 6 months without success.\n\n**Tina** is slang for crystal methamphetamine (i.e., from crystal to Christina to Tina). **Bath salts** is slang for a powder that contains a variety of synthetic stimulants (e.g., cathinone derivatives).\n\nSince Mr. Vincent had started using cocaine regularly, he had lost weight and had trouble sleeping. He worried that his effort at the gym was going to waste. His business continued to succeed, but his own effectiveness had decreased. Most importantly, he did not practice safer sex when high on stimulants, and because he did not want to be on a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimen, he worried about HIV seroconversion.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Oliver Vincent's behavior suggests a diagnosis of  **Substance Use Disorder**, specifically related to alcohol and cocaine. His pattern of use, described as 'party and play' activities three to four times a week, indicates a dependence and inability to control his substance consumption."

His mother gave him several tablets of hydrocodone-acetaminophen that she had for back pain, and he found this helpful. When he ran out of the pills and his pain persisted, he went to the emergency room. He was told he had a mild sprain. He was given a 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. He took the pills as prescribed for 1 month, and his pain resolved.\n\nAfter stopping the pills, however, Mr. Winters began to experience a recurrence of the pain in his knee. He saw an orthopedist, who ordered imaging studies and determined that there was no structural damage. Mr. Winters was given another 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. This time, however, he needed to take more than prescribed in order to ease the pain. He also felt dysphoric and achy when he abstained from taking the medication, and described a craving for more opioids. He returned to the orthopedist, who referred him to a pain specialist.\n\nMr. Winters was too embarrassed to go to the pain specialist, believing that his faith and strength should help him overcome the pain. He found it impossible to live without the pain medication, however, because of the pain, dysphoria, and muscle aches when he stopped the medication. He also began to enjoy the high and experienced intense craving. He began to frequent emergency rooms to receive more opioids, often lying about the timing and nature of his right knee pain, and even stole pills from his mother on two occasions. He became preoccupied with trying to find more opioids, and his work and home life suffered. He endorsed low mood, especially when contemplating the impact of opioids on his life, but denied any other mood or neurovegetative symptoms. Eventually, he told his primary care doctor about his opioid use and low mood, and that doctor referred him to the outpatient psychiatry clinic.\n\nMr. Winters had a history of two lifetime major depressive episodes that were treated successfully with escitalopram by his primary care doctor. He also had a history of an alcohol use disorder when he was in his 20s. He managed to quit using alcohol on his own after a family intervention. He smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. His father suffered from depression, and almost everyone on his mother's side of the family had issues with addiction. He had been married to his wife for 20 years, and they had two school-age children. He had been a minister in his church for 15 years. Results of a recent physical examination and laboratory testing performed by his primary care physician had been within normal limits.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Winters was cooperative and did not exhibit any psychomotor abnormalities. He answered most questions briefly, often simply saying yes or no. Speech was of a normal rate and tone, without tangentiality or circumstantiality. He reported that his mood was lousy, and his affect was dysphoric and constricted. He denied symptoms of paranoia or hallucinations. He denied any thoughts of harming himself or others. Memory, both recent and remote, was grossly intact.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Winters's symptoms align with opioid use disorder.  He exhibits cravings, experiences withdrawal symptoms, and engages in behaviors to obtain opioids despite negative consequences. His history of misuse also supports this diagnosis."

Silberstein, M.D.**\n\n**Raymond Xavier**, a **divorced 29-year-old semi-employed landscaper**, presented to a private psychiatrist with a complaint that his life was in a **downward spiral**. At the time of the appointment, he had been without a **permanent home for over 6 months**. He had lived in various places, including his **car and friends' homes**. For over **1 month prior to presentation**, he had been living in a **tent in the woods**. He had called his parents on his recent birthday, and they had offered to pay for **substance use disorder treatment** as long as they could pay directly.\n\nMr. Xavier reported that his problem started at **age 24**, when he had a new wife and young child and had taken on two jobs to make ends meet (working in a factory and as a local delivery driver). When he injured his back and could not get to work because of the pain, a friend offered him a few tablets of **acetaminophen-oxycodone (Percocet)**. Not only did his pain disappear, but his **energy and mood improved**. For the first time in his life, he felt **normal and happy**.\n\nMr. Xavier continued to use one to four **Percocet tablets per day for 1.5 years**. He never took more than one pill at a time. Then, at age **26**, he snorted half a bag of **heroin** (about $5 on the street). It took about 10 minutes, but he was transported into an **indescribable euphoria**. **\"Like taking that first Percocet times 10. You chase that first feeling for the rest of your life. It never repeats.\"** Within months of starting heroin, he began using it **intravenously** in an effort to glimpse the euphoria again.\n\nAfter that first experience with heroin, the progression of use was rapid. Within **6 months**, Mr. Xavier was **unemployed, separated from his family, and homeless**. **\"I was sleeping in my car or on the streets using up to 30 bags [$300] daily.\"**\n\nMr. Xavier began to reach out for help. He enrolled in **outpatient rehabilitation for opioid users**. The cravings to use, even while in treatment, were intense. Mr. Xavier reported **multiple relapses**. He added **cocaine** to the heroin injections, and **speedballs** became Mr. Xavier's drug of choice for a while, but he then returned to using only heroin. The first of multiple **accidental overdoses** occurred in a vacant house when he was **27**. He had been admitted to about **10 detoxes and rehabs** but would typically relapse within hours or weeks of discharge. He had also gone sporadically to **Narcotics Anonymous meetings** for years.\n\nTo acquire money for his habit, he **broke into homes, stole from relatives**, and **wrote bad checks**. **\"Every penny went to drugs. I'm lucky not to be in prison, but not so lucky in that everybody hates me.\"**\n\nHe decided to move to **Martha's Vineyard** a year prior to the consultation because it sounded like a **quiet place**. He brought some **methadone** with him, but the eventual withdrawal was fierce. He continued to use heroin and oxycodone when he could easily get them. Otherwise, he **drank alcohol heavily**, although he said, **\"I need to stop drinking—that's what really gets me in trouble.\"** He also took **diazepam (Valium) sporadically**; however, he did not consider that to be a problem but more of a way to **get through the day**.\n\nHe worked occasionally as a **landscaper**. His boss—someone he had met at a **Narcotics Anonymous meeting**—had made it clear that he would call when there was extra work to be done, but that until Mr. Xavier got clean, the boss would not actually expect him to show up. He had held a variety of other **odd jobs**, including **office supplies salesman, veterinary assistant, and gas station attendant**. He had not seen his **daughter in over 2 years**.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Xavier appeared somewhat **unkempt**. He was generally cooperative but appeared **restless**, and at one point he urgently left the room; when he returned, he reported that he was experiencing bouts of **diarrhea**. His pupils were enlarged and his skin was remarkable for **sweating and piloerection**. He yawned several times and appeared **irritable and unhappy**. His arms and legs frequently twitched. He repeatedly blew his nose and appeared tearful. His speech was **rapid**, and he appeared **impatient**.\n\nHe denied **psychotic symptoms, suicidality**, and **homicidality**. He said he was hopeful that if he could get some **Suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone)**, he might be able to **keep a job** and maybe get to be a real **father**.\n\nLaboratory studies were negative for **HIV** and **hepatitis A, B, and C**.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Xavier's case most likely aligns with  **Opioid Use Disorder (ICD-11 code F11.20)**. His history of chronic opioid misuse, dependence, and unsuccessful attempts at quitting strongly suggest this diagnosis.   "

Kosten, M.D.**\n\n**Daryl Shorter, M.D.**\n\nShaun Yates, a **32-year-old married African American information technology (IT) security analyst**, presented for treatment with a private psychiatrist because he felt stressed. He and his wife have two young children, and he reports a stable social life that includes a large extended family. This was his first psychiatric evaluation. He reported no past psychiatric history.\n\nMr. Yates traced his increased stress to a death in his city 4 months earlier. The death was recorded on video and featured an **unarmed Black man being murdered by two white off-duty policemen** who had accused him of theft. Like many people, Mr. Yates first saw the video via his social media timeline, where it was routinely reposted by his friends. Because the murder had occurred in his hometown, it received much local attention.\n\nMr. Yates's social media timeline began to fill up with other examples of **police brutality toward Black men**. He said he watched the videos because they were trending and appeared on his social media timeline abruptly, unfiltered, and without warning. In addition, he became increasingly aware of news programming, social media posts, and community memorials relating to the deaths and abuse of other Black men. Although he described trying to avoid details about these tragedies, he said that news, images, and videos were unavoidable, and he had become increasingly preoccupied with fears for the safety of his wife, his young sons, his extended family, and himself.\n\nMr. Yates reported that under normal circumstances, he didn't like to talk about this stuff, but his wife had insisted that he get treatment because she was concerned that he didn't seem himself. Mr. Yates wanted the evaluating psychiatrist to understand that he was not paranoid or overly sensitive about racism, and that up until recently, he'd been good about compartmentalizing. Nevertheless, he admitted that it had become difficult to stop thinking about violence against unarmed Black men. He had recently disabled his social media accounts in a proactive effort to minimize his exposure to images and commentary regarding the incidents. In addition to stopping use of social media, he reported avoidance of newspapers, the internet, and television.\n\nMr. Yates noted that he had also become **edgy, nervous, and always on guard against attack**. He had gradually reduced his explorations around the city, preferring to stay close to home. Although he had previously jogged every morning before work, he quit jogging in the local community park because he didn't want any trouble. Mr. Yates reported his sleep over the past 3 months as being interrupted by **vivid, disturbing dreams of being chased by police officers**.\n\nFor Mr. Yates, evenings were particularly stressful, and he had recently increased his use of **alcohol and cannabis** to unwind at the end of the day. He also had begun to drink a six-pack, or more, of beer after dinner, often passing out in the family den. The alcohol helped him to relax, and smoking a blunt of marijuana before bedtime improved his sleep and reduced nightmares. He stated that the biggest problem with the cannabis was his wife's complaining that their young children might see him using it or that his use might be detected in a random urine toxicology screen at work. Mr. Yates had been increasingly late to work but had not mentioned to his wife that he had twice been reprimanded by his supervisor for the lateness.\n\nMr. Yates reported first using both cannabis and alcohol at fraternity parties when he was about **19 years old**. Throughout college, he smoked small amounts of marijuana once or twice weekly and rarely drank more than two beers at a time. In the decade since his college graduation, he had smoked marijuana only occasionally and tended to have no more than 1 or 2 beers on the weekend. He had never smoked tobacco or used other substances. His use of alcohol and cannabis had not increased until **3 months prior to the evaluation**, after he started seeing the videos.\n\nMr. Yates denied experiencing feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or hopelessness. He reported no prior history of panic attacks, mania, psychosis, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and he had never received psychiatric hospitalization or outpatient treatment. He denied suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, or previous history of suicidality. There was no family psychiatric history aside from his father, who developed posttraumatic stress disorder following military service in Vietnam.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Shaun Yates's symptoms align with **adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood**.  He is experiencing significant emotional distress due to a stressful event (the death of an unarmed Black man in his city) and exhibits changes in behavior, including increased alcohol and cannabis use. His symptoms are causing him impairment in his work and social life."

He denied having any prior history of a psychiatric or substance use disorder. He was appropriately dressed and groomed, expressed himself fluently in both English and Spanish, spoke in normal tone and volume, and on examination presented with intact cognitive function and average intelligence.\n\n**Mr. Zambrano** had been betting on sports and playing cards since childhood, noting in the evaluation that \"gambling is part of our culture.\" His own father's favorite hobby and stress reliever had been to play poker with friends at night, and Mr. Zambrano remembered with affection the father-son camaraderie they shared on these occasions.\n\nPoker became for him a familial activity that he increasingly used to relieve work-related stress. He relished the excitement as well as the intellectual challenge and competition.\n\nCard games did not, however, remain a benign pastime for Mr. Zambrano. He had begun to lose more money than he could afford. Over the 2 years prior to his presentation for treatment, he had gradually increased the frequency and stakes of his poker nights.\n\nWhen he lost, he tended to place even larger bets, convinced that the odds would favor him the following time. When he won, he felt great and would continue to play, convinced he was on a streak. Although losses made him feel unworthy, stupid, and irritable, he believed success would come if he could fine-tune his strategy. He felt a powerful, almost constant impulse to increase the tempo of his gambling and recover the money he had lost. When he tried to cut back on gambling, he felt irritable and preoccupied, and quickly returned to his poker nights.\n\nBy the time **Mr. Zambrano** presented to the gambling clinic, he felt desperate. Nightly poker had led to daytime fatigue and poor performance at his coaching job, which he had previously loved. He was consumed with thoughts about his next poker game. His wife and son had long resented his time away from the family, but his wife had just found out that he had used up his son's college fund plus accumulated $30,000 in credit card debt. When his wife threatened to file for divorce, he felt sad and depressed and decided to seek treatment.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on Mr. Zambrano's gambling behavior and its negative impact on his life,  a diagnosis of **Gambling Disorder** (6C59) from the ICD-11 is appropriate. His inability to control his gambling despite negative consequences aligns with the diagnostic criteria."

It was late in the evening, and no one from the admitting team was available, but a social work note in the chart indicated that the patient's fracture appeared to have been the result of his tripping in his messy apartment. The note also stated that the patient had no children or known living family.\n\n**The neighbor** who had brought Mr. Alvarez to the hospital had stated that the patient had been more reclusive in recent years and that his self-care had worsened after his wife's death 6 months earlier. Up until the day of the surgery, however, he had been able to function independently in his apartment. The neighbor, a nurse, also mentioned that while they were waiting for the ambulance, her husband had sat with Mr. Alvarez while she searched the apartment for pill bottles. She said she had found only an unopened bottle of acetaminophen and a dusty bottle of a medication used for hypertension.\n\n**Routine admission laboratory results** indicated that Mr. Alvarez had an elevated blood urea nitrogen level, a low albumin level, and a high normal mean corpuscular volume. His blood pressure was 160/110. In addition to medications related to the surgery, the chart indicated that he had received haloperidol 2 mg after a bout of agitation. A nursing note 1 hour after the haloperidol administration indicated that the patient was worried and stiff.\n\n**On mental status examination**, Mr. Alvarez was lying at a 45-degree angle in his unkempt bed. He appeared thin and had moderate temporal wasting. His affect was sad, worried, and constricted. He appeared stiff and uncomfortable. He did not immediately respond to the interviewer's questions and comments. His eyes remained generally shut, but they did flicker open a few times, and his body habitus implied that he was awake.\n\nAfter multiple efforts, the psychiatrist was able to get the patient to say **I'm fine and Get out**. When asked where he was, Mr. Alvarez said, **My apartment**. When he did open his eyes, the patient appeared confused. He did not respond to other questions and declined to do a clock drawing test. The surgery team had called in a one-to-one companion earlier in the day, and she said that the patient was generally either asleep or trying to get out of bed and that he had not been making any sense all day.",

Mr. Alvarez presents with symptoms of depression, potential cognitive decline, and possible medication side effects. Further evaluation and assessment are needed to determine an accurate diagnosis.

According to his sister, Mr. Brown had been running around the kitchen with knives, sending paranoid e-mails about the justice system to his friends, showing his guns to the neighbors, seeing people in the walls, having paranoid thoughts that his wife was having an affair, and not sleeping. The patient's wife had reported him missing 3 days prior to admission. Notably, his car was found a few blocks away with a large box in its trunk containing bags filled with numerous medication bottles (both prescribed and over the counter); most of the bottles were partially or completely empty. There were also many items from the patient's extensive gun collection.\n\n**Mr. Brown's medical records revealed a history of coronary artery disease and a coronary artery bypass graft 5 years prior to admission, as well as chronic back pain and a history of multiple spinal surgeries, with an associated history of daily opioid use.** He had no prior psychiatric history, including any history of depression or antidepressant medications. His outpatient medications included metoprolol, oxycodone, and as-needed doses of cyclobenzaprine and diazepam.\n\n**On examination, Mr. Brown was confused and combative, yet somnolent.** His skin and oral mucosa were dry, and he manifested mydriasis, hypoactive bowel sounds, urinary retention, epistaxis, and depressed reflexes. His vital signs included a temperature of 39.9\u00b0C, a heart rate of 115 bpm, and blood pressure of 172/74, but his breathing rate was normal, and his oxygen saturation was normal on room air. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was negative, and a CT of the cervical spine showed degeneration. Mr. Brown's blood alcohol screen was negative, and complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel results were within normal limits, as were the electrocardiogram and cerebrospinal fluid from a lumbar puncture. His urine toxicology screen was positive for benzodiazepines and tricyclics.\n\n**Mr. Brown's mental status examination revealed waxing and waning alertness, an unkempt appearance, lack of cooperation with nursing and medical personnel, somewhat slurred speech, and signs of psychomotor retardation.** His affect alternated between subdued/somnolent and restless/agitated. He denied suicidal or homicidal ideation but reported significant paranoid ideation that focused on his wife's suspected affair. He also appeared to be suffering from both visual and auditory misperceptions- accusing people of laughing at him and misidentifying hospital staff as acquaintances. His thought process was notably tangential. His judgment and insight were impaired. During his initial evaluation, the patient was noted to have a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 16 of 30 possible points. He lost 7 of 10 points for orientation, 3 for attention and calculation, 2 for recall, and 1 each for sentence writing and copying design.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, a diagnosis of bipolar type II disorder cannot be made.  The patient's presentation suggests acute psychosis with possible mixed features due to medication toxicity or delirium. Further investigation and observation are needed to determine the underlying cause."

        "clinical_case": "**Peter V. Rabins, M.D., M.P.H.**\n\n**Arthur Cullman**, a 71-year-old married man, was referred to a psychiatrist by his primary care physician for evaluation of depressive symptoms that had not responded to medication trials. His wife reported that Mr. Cullman had begun to change at age 68, about a year after his retirement. He had gradually stopped playing golf and cards, activities he had enjoyed for decades. He had explained that seeing his friends was no longer fun, and he generally refused to socialize. Instead, he sat on the couch all day, worrying about finances and the future. He denied sadness, however, and any suicidal or homicidal ideation. His wife said he was sleeping 10-12 hours a day instead of his customary 7 hours and that he had, uncharacteristically, gained 8 pounds in less than 1 year.\n\nHis wife had become worried that retirement had left Mr. Cullman depressed, and she had mentioned her concerns to their primary care physician. Their physician agreed and prescribed sertraline (titrated to 100 mg/day for 8 months) and then sustained-release venlafaxine (titrated to 150 mg twice daily and maintained at that level for over 1 year). Mr. Cullman's symptoms gradually worsened during these medication trials, and the internist ultimately referred him for a psychiatric evaluation.\n\n**Mr. Cullman's past psychiatric history** was notable for an episode in his 20s when he had difficulty at work, felt apathetic and unconnected, and had difficulty concentrating. These symptoms persisted for several months and resolved without treatment as his work situation improved.\n\n**Mr. Cullman's family history** was positive for a single major depressive episode in one of his two younger brothers; the depression responded well to psychotherapy and an antidepressant medication. His mother had developed dementia in her 70s.\n\n**Mr. Cullman's personal history** revealed unremarkable development and childhood, graduation from college with a degree in business, a successful career as a corporate manager, and retirement at age 67. He and his wife had been married for 45 years, denied significant discord, and had three children and four grandchildren who were in good health. Premorbidly, he had been outgoing, energetic, and well organized.\n\n**Mr. Cullman's medical history** was notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was taking lisinopril, metformin, simvastatin, and venlafaxine.\n\n**Mental status examination** revealed an alert, cooperative man who was neatly dressed and who had a steady but slow gait and no abnormal movements other than psychomotor slowing. Mr. Cullman's speech was soft in volume but normal in rate and rhythm, without paraphasic errors. He had a limited range of emotional expression, denied feeling sad or guilty, but felt he had retired too early. He denied self-blame, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts or plans. He was aware that his wife was concerned and acknowledged that he was less energetic and active than in the past. He ascribed these changes to his retirement. He said he was generally satisfied with his life.\n\n**On cognitive examination**, Mr. Cullman was oriented except for the date. He remembered one of three objects in 2 minutes, performed three of five serial 7 subtractions correctly, named four common objects correctly, and repeated a complex sentence accurately. He was able to draw the face of a clock and place the numbers correctly but was not able to correctly place the hands at 10 minutes after 2. His blood pressure was 142/82, and his pulse was 84 and regular. His physical examination was noncontributory. His neurological examination revealed intact cranial nerves and 1+ symmetric deep tendon reflexes.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Cullman's symptoms align with a diagnosis of **Major Depressive Disorder (F32)** from the ICD-11.  He exhibits persistent low mood, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, changes in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness, all lasting for at least two weeks. While his cognitive abilities are mildly impaired, they do not meet the criteria for dementia."

She had **reduced her social interactions**, stopped going to her senior citizens center, and dropped out of her weekly card game because she experienced **no pleasure** and could not adequately concentrate. She had **lost 7 pounds in the prior 2 months**, and her sleep was interrupted by periods of **insomnia with agonizing ruminations**. This was the **first time** she had experienced any psychiatric symptoms.\n\nMs. Druker had retired 10 years earlier after a successful career as an attorney. She had been divorced for 30 years. Her two children and three grandchildren lived nearby, and she had been seeing them often before this episode.\n\nMs. Drucker had **hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of coronary occlusion** for which she had received a stent. She was taking **hydrochlorothiazide, the angiotensin receptor inhibitor olmesartan, atorvastatin, and low-dose aspirin**. She had smoked half a pack of cigarettes per day for about 30 years.\n\nOn examination, Ms. Drucker was **disheveled and appeared drained of energy**. She took a long time to respond to questions. She had a **depressed, anxious mood and a sad affect**, and was preoccupied with her finances but could be temporarily reassured. She complained of **forgetfulness**; on examination, she was able to recall two out of four objects in 3 minutes and recognized a third when given several choices. She could think of 14 items available in a supermarket over a period of 1 minute. She failed to cluster items of similar kind. Ms. Drucker had difficulty producing a list of vegetables alternating with items of clothing; she produced 12 correct responses and 4 errors. She spaced the hours unequally in drawing a clock but placed the hands correctly. The patient's **Mini-Mental State Examination score was 24**. She gave 22 correct responses over 1 minute in the **Stroop Test**, which measures response inhibition by asking the person to identify the color of ink in which incongruous words are written (e.g., the word RED written in blue ink).\n\nA neurological examination was essentially unremarkable, with the exception of a mild drop on the left side of her mouth. A **CT head scan revealed pronounced periventricular and subcortical white matter hyperintensities**.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Ms. Drucker's symptoms align more closely with  Major Depressive Disorder (F32) rather than Bipolar II disorder in remission. Her presentation includes persistent sadness, loss of interest, sleep disturbances, and cognitive difficulties consistent with depression. While her symptoms may initially appear similar to bipolar disorder, the lack of history of manic or hypomanic episodes makes Major Depressive Disorder a more likely diagnosis."

Galvin, M.D., M.P.H.**\n\n**Carl Estel**, a 74-year-old right-handed married man, was brought for a neuropsychiatric evaluation after a multi-year decline marked by **stiffness, forgetfulness, and apathy**. His wife had been trying to get him in for an evaluation for years and had finally become desperate enough to enlist his brothers to bring him for the evaluation.\n\n**Mrs. Estel** described her husband's problems as starting when he retired from his job as a plumbing contractor at age 65. He had seemed out of sorts almost immediately, and she had wondered at the time whether he was getting depressed. He became uncharacteristically forgetful, misplacing items and neglecting to pay bills. He had trouble with appointments, medications, and calculations. He had refused to see a physician until he was involved in a traffic accident a few years prior to this evaluation. At that time, a physician had found no significant physical injuries but had said that the accident was caused by **inattention and diminished depth perception**; she had recommended that Mr. Estel stop driving, and suggested that he get a more thorough evaluation for early dementia.\n\nOver the past year, things had gotten worse. Mr. Estel often could not recall the outcome of sporting events that he had just watched on television, although his memory improved with cues. He resisted activities such as travel and socializing that he had previously enjoyed. A former athlete, he stopped taking walks around the neighborhood after several falls. He quit playing cards with neighbors because the rules had become confusing. He looked depressed and acted apathetic but generally said he was fine. His judgment and problem-solving skills appeared to have significantly declined. Despite having completed 4 years of college and worked for many years as a successful professional plumber, Mr. Estel was now periodically unable to operate household appliances.\n\nAll of these cognitive problems seemed to fluctuate, so that his wife reported that sometimes he was almost like his old self, whereas at other times it was like living with a zombie, a depressed zombie. She also described his **frequent exhaustion, daytime drowsiness, and staring spells**.\n\nWhen asked specifically about her husband's sleep, Mrs. Estel reported that in fact neither of them slept well. Mainly, she said, it was because of her husband acting out his dreams. During these episodes, which occurred several times a month, he would punch and scream, and would occasionally fall out of bed. After sustaining bruises as a result of several of the episodes, Mrs. Estel decided it would be safer to sleep on the couch. She recalled that these sleep episodes began just before her husband retired; she had wondered at the time whether he had posttraumatic stress disorder, but she did not think he had suffered any particular trauma. A few years earlier, a friend had offered her a sleeping pill that had helped her own husband with dementia. Mr. Estel had responded to the unknown medication with **extreme rigidity and confusion**, and his wife had nearly taken him to the emergency room in the middle of the night.\n\n**Mrs. Estel** denied that her husband had ever had any psychiatric illness. When asked about psychotic symptoms, she said that perhaps every week or so, he swatted at invisible things in the air. She did not think he heard voices or felt suspicious.\n\n**Mr. Estel's medical history** was notable for hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disease with a history of stent placement, and possible transient ischemic attacks. His family history was positive for his mother having developed dementia in her mid-70s.\n\nOn examination, **Mr. Estel** was a stooped, stiff man who shuffled into the office. While listening to his wife present the history, he stared into space, seeming to pay no attention to the content of the conversation. His right hand was tremulous. He appeared depressed, but when asked, he said he felt fine. His voice was so quiet that words were often unintelligible even when the interviewer leaned close. He drooled at times and did not notice until his wife wiped his chin.\n\nWhen asked to participate in cognitive testing, he shrugged his shoulders and said, I don't know.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Estel's symptoms point towards a possible diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.  His cognitive decline, memory loss, apathy, and behavioral changes are consistent with this diagnosis.  Further testing and evaluation would be needed to confirm the diagnosis."

Kocsis, M.D.**\n\n**Dorothy Franklin**, a 54-year-old married former waitress, was brought into the psychiatric emergency room (ER) by her husband for escalating delusions and visual hallucinations. Her husband reported that she had been episodically agitated for about 10 years, uncharacteristically suspicious for about 6 months, and complaining of daily hallucinations for weeks to months. The patient referred to her experience as \"my nightmare.\" In a terrified voice, she explained, \"I see a judge standing in front of me. Plain as day. He is a good judge, but he threatens to kill me, and I can't stop him. I can't believe no one else can see him. Can you help?\"\n\nMr. Franklin reports that his wife had been completely fine until about a decade earlier, when she was in her early 40s. At that point, he reports that she had become frequently agitated, paranoid, worried, and occasionally aggressive. He had brought her to psychiatrists and internists, and she had received several diagnoses, including **late-onset schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, paranoid personality, and anxiety**.\n\nShe and her husband could not recall the names of all of the many psychiatric medications that she had been prescribed over the years, but they included antidepressant, antipsychotic, antianxiety, and mood-stabilizing medications.\n\nMs. Franklin had smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day for many years but only rarely drank alcohol and never used recreational drugs. She had worked as a waitress for 20 years but quit 10 years prior to the evaluation because of too many dropped trays, misremembered customer orders, and uncharacteristic irritability. Around that time, she was arrested for hitting someone in a shopping mall, and she and her husband decided she needed to reduce her stress level.\n\nThe patient had two healthy adult children in their late 20s. She had one sister with depression and irritability. The patient's mother had passed away 10 years earlier at age 70. She had been wheelchair bound for years because of severe dementia, postural instability, and involuntary movements. The patient's maternal grandfather got sick in his late 50s and completed suicide with a firearm at age 62.\n\nOn mental status examination in the ER, Ms. Franklin was frightened but cooperative. She appeared her stated age, with thin body habitus and good grooming and hygiene. She sat next to her husband, holding his hand and often looking to him when asked questions. She had moderate psychomotor slowing, and noticeable involuntary dancelike movements of her trunk and upper extremities. Her eye contact was intermittent but intense. Ms. Franklin described her mood as \"not well at all,\" and her affect was blunted and minimally reactive. Her speech was soft and slowed, with minimal spontaneity. Her thought process was linear but slowed. She was preoccupied by paranoid delusions and visual hallucinations. She reported actively hallucinating during the interview. She denied suicidal and homicidal thoughts or plans. On cognitive examination, she was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. She had good attention and concentration, although she had significant impairments in both short- and long-term memory. Her performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination and clock drawing test revealed moderate impairment in planning and visuospatial tasks.\n\nIn the ER, results from extensive laboratory testing were normal. The patient was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit for safety and for further workup of her psychotic symptoms.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, a possible diagnosis for Ms. Franklin could be Delusional Disorder due to her persistent delusions of a threatening judge and hallucinations. Her history of fluctuating symptoms and past diagnoses, including late-onset schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,  suggest a complex psychiatric presentation. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the specific subtype of delusional disorder and rule out other potential contributing factors."

Hales, M.D., M.B.A.**\n\nOnly upon the repeated and fervent insistence of her parents did 19-year-old Emily reluctantly agree to see a psychiatrist. \"It's not me you want to see,\" Emily proclaimed emphatically. \"It's my insane parents who need your help.\" Emily did not offer a chief complaint, aside from the concern that her parents were driving her crazy. She added, \"Everything is going great in my life. I have plenty of friends, go out almost every night, and always have lots of fun.\"\n\nWhile Emily was taking some time away from the so-called real world, her sister was attending Duke University, her younger brother was excelling at a competitive private high school, and both her parents seemed to enjoy their careers as radiologists. She asked, \"Don't you think that's enough strivers for one family?\"\n\nEmily agreed to have her parents join the session, and they told a different story. They tearfully disclosed that their daughter had become irritable, unproductive, and oppositional. She drank to intoxication almost every night, often not returning home for an entire weekend. In searching her room, they had found small amounts of marijuana, alprazolam (Xanax), cocaine, and prescription stimulants. The parents described the changes in Emily's personality as an \"adolescent nightmare\" and described her friends as \"losers who do nothing but dye their hair, get tattoos, and hate everything.\" Emily's attitudes and behavior contrasted markedly with those of her parents and siblings. \"We don't mind that she is doing her own thing and that she isn't conservative like the rest of us,\" her father said, \"but it's like we don't even recognize who she's become.\"\n\nAccording to her parents, Emily's \"adolescent nightmare\" began 4 years earlier. She had apparently been a studious 15-year-old girl with a lively sense of humor and a wide circle of terrific friends. Almost overnight, she began to shun her longtime friends in favor of dropouts and malcontents and began to accumulate traffic tickets and school detentions. Instead of her former bright-eyed curiosity, Emily manifested a lack of interest in all her academic subjects, and her grades dropped from As to Ds. The parents were at an absolute loss to explain the sudden and dramatic change.\n\nThe abrupt change in performance led the psychiatrist to ask Emily to take a battery of neuropsychological tests so the results could be compared with those of tests that she had taken when she had applied to a private high school several years earlier. In particular, Emily retook two high school admissions tests: the System for Assessment and Group Evaluation (SAGE), which measures a broad array of academic and perceptual aptitudes, and the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), which focus on reasoning, spelling, and perceptual skills.\n\nOn the SAGE, her average percentile scores dropped from the upper 10% for a 13-year-old to the bottom 10% for an adult (and the bottom 20% for a 13-year-old). When Emily took the DAT at age 13, she scored in the highest range for ninth graders across almost all measures. Her worst result had been in spelling, where she scored at the second-highest level. Upon repeating the test at age 19, she scored below the high school average in all measures.\n\nEEG, brain CT, and T2-weighted brain MRI scans showed no evidence of structural brain damage. However, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-weighted MRI displayed a clear lesion in the left frontal cortex, highly suggestive of previous injury to that region.\n\nUpon further questioning about the crucial period in which she seemed to have changed, Emily admitted to being in a traffic accident with her now ex-boyfriend, Mark. Although Emily did not recall much from this episode, she remembered that she hit her head and that she had bad headaches for many weeks thereafter. Because Emily was not bleeding and there was no damage to the car, neither Mark nor Emily reported the incident to anyone. With Emily's permission, the psychiatrist contacted Mark, who was away at college but a willing and excellent historian. He remembered the incident well. \"Emily hit her head very, very hard on the dashboard of my car. She was not totally unconscious but very dazed. For about 3 hours, she spoke very slowly, complained that her head hurt badly, and was confused. For about 2 hours she didn't know where she was or what day it was. She also threw up twice. I was really scared, but Emily didn't want me to worry her parents since they're so overprotective. And then she broke up with me, and we've hardly spoken since.\"",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided context, Emily's symptoms including personality changes,  cognitive decline, and substance use following a head injury suggest a possible diagnosis of **Personality traits or coping style affecting disorders or diseases classified elsewhere (6E40.2)**. The traumatic brain injury could be contributing to her behavioral and psychological issues. It's important to note that this is just a potential diagnosis based on the limited information provided.  A full evaluation by a qualified professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis."

Siever, M.D.**\n\nDr. Siever passed away in 2021.\n\n**Frazier Archer's Case**\n\nFrazier Archer was a 34-year-old single white man who called a mood and personality disorders research program because an ex-friend had once said he was borderline, and Mr. Archer wanted to learn more about his personality.\n\nDuring his diagnostic research interview, Mr. Archer was initially reluctant to share personal information, citing a concern that his words would be misunderstood, misconstrued, or used against him.  When asked about his relationships, he described regular, almost daily situations in which he was sure he was being lied to or deceived. He was particularly wary of people in leadership positions and people who had studied psychology and, therefore, had training to understand the human mind, which they used to manipulate people. Unlike those around him, Mr. Archer believed he did not drink the Kool-Aid and was able to detect manipulation and deceit.\n\nMr. Archer was employed as an assistant manager for a grocery store chain. He was extremely detail oriented at work, and had trouble delegating and completing tasks. He noted that his coworkers consistently failed to complete tasks the way that he would like. This led him to work routinely long hours fixing their mistakes. Numerous employers and colleagues had told him that he focused excessively on rules, lists, and small details, and that he needed to be more friendly. He described having held numerous jobs over the years, but he was quick to add, \"I've quit as often as I've been fired.\"\n\nDuring the interview, he emphasized that unlike many people, he understood the value of quality over productivity. He believed that his high standards had contributed to his bad temper and emotional ups and downs. He socialized only superficially with a handful of acquaintances and could recall the exact moments when previous so-called friends and lovers had betrayed him. He spent most of his time alone.\n\nMr. Archer denied any significant history of trauma, any current or past problems with substance use, and any history of head trauma or loss of consciousness. He also denied any history of mental health diagnosis or treatment, but he did feel he might have a mental health condition that had not yet been diagnosed. He described some social anxiety and difficulties with academic achievement in childhood, which he attributed to his own high standards and unreliable childhood friends.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Archer appeared well groomed, cooperative, and oriented. His speech varied; at times he would pause thoughtfully prior to answering questions and provide very slow, deliberate responses. At other points in the interview he became angry and offered lengthy and digressive responses. However, he seemed generally coherent and did not evidence any perceptual disturbances. His affect was occasionally inappropriate (e.g., smiling while crying) and generally constricted. He reported apathy as to whether he lived or died but did not report any active suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.\n\nNotably, Mr. Archer became irritated and argumentative with research staff when he was told that although he could receive verbal feedback on his interviews, he could not receive a copy of the completed questionnaires and diagnostic tools. He commented that he would document in his personal records that research staff were refusing him the forms.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Archer's presentation aligns more with characteristics of  obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). His excessive attention to rules and details, difficulty delegating, perfectionism, and rigid thinking pattern are consistent with this diagnosis.   Further evaluation by a qualified mental health professional is recommended for a definitive diagnosis."

Apparently, his 90-year-old sister had died some days earlier after a lengthy illness. Mr. Buchalski had delayed reporting her death for several reasons. He had become increasingly disorganized as his sister's health had worsened, and he was worried that his landlord would use the apartment's condition as a pretext for eviction. He had tried to clean up, but his attempts consisted mainly of moving items from one place to another. He said he was about to call for help when the police and paramedics showed up.\n\nIn the ER, Mr. Buchalski recognized that his actions were odd and that he should have called for help sooner. At times, he became tearful when discussing the situation and his sister's death; at other times, he seemed aloof, speaking about these in a calm, factual way. He also wanted to clarify that his apartment had indeed been a mess but that much of the apparent mess was actually his large collection of articles on **bioluminescence**, a topic he had been researching for decades.\n\nA licensed plumber, electrician, and locksmith, Mr. Buchalski had worked until age 65. He described his late sister as having been always a little strange. She had never worked and had been married once, briefly. Aside from the several-month marriage, she and Mr. Buchalski had lived in the family's two-bedroom Manhattan apartment their entire lives. Neither of them had ever seen a psychiatrist.\n\nWhen questioned, Mr. Buchalski stated that he had never had a romantic or sexual relationship and had never had many friends or social contacts outside his family. He explained that he had been poor and Polish and had had to work all the time. He had taken night classes to better understand the strange world we live in, and he said his intellectual interests were what he found most gratifying. He said he had been upset as he realized that his sister was dying, but he would call it numb rather than depressed. He also denied any history of manic or psychotic symptoms. After an hour with the psychiatric trainee, Mr. Buchalski confided that he hoped the medical school might be interested in some of his papers after his death. He said he believed that **bioluminescent and genetic technologies** were on the verge of a breakthrough that might allow the skin of animals and then humans to glow in subtle colors that would allow people to more directly recognize emotions. He had written the notes for such technology, but they had grown into a way-too-long science fiction novel with lots of footnotes.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Buchalski was a thin, elderly man dressed neatly in khakis and button-down shirt. He was meticulous and much preferred to discuss his interests in science than his own story. He made appropriate eye contact and had a polite, pleasant demeanor. His speech was coherent and goal directed. His mood was fine, and his affect was appropriate though perhaps unusually cheerful under the circumstances. He denied all symptoms of psychosis, depression, and mania. Aside from his comments about bioluminescence, he said nothing that sounded delusional. He was cognitively intact, and his insight and judgment were considered generally good, although historically impaired in regard to his delay in calling the police about his sister.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Buchalski's symptoms align more with **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Fair to Good Insight (6B20.0)**.  His preoccupation with cleaning and organizing, coupled with his distress over his apartment's condition, suggests obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. However, his recognition that his actions were unusual and his tearfulness indicate some level of insight into his condition. "

Scott, M.D.**\n\n**Ike Crocker** was a **32-year-old white divorced carpenter** referred for a mental health evaluation by the **human resources department** of a large construction business that had been his employer for **2 weeks**. At his initial job interview, Mr. Crocker presented as very motivated and provided two carpentry school certifications that indicated a high level of skill and training. Since his employment began, his supervisors had noted **frequent arguments, absenteeism, poor workmanship, and multiple errors** that might have been dangerous. When confronted, he was reportedly dismissive, indicating that the problem was cheap wood and bad management and added that if someone got hurt, it's because of their own stupidity.\n\nWhen the head of **human resources** met with him to discuss termination, Mr. Crocker quickly pointed out that he had both **attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)** and **bipolar disorder**. He said that if not granted an accommodation under the **Americans with Disabilities Act**, he would sue. He demanded a **psychiatric evaluation**.\n\nDuring the mental health evaluation, Mr. Crocker focused on **unfairness at the company** and on how he was a hell of a better carpenter than anyone there could ever be. He claimed that his two **marriages** had ended because of **jealousy**. He said that his wives were always thinking, *I was with other women*, which is why they both lied to judges and got **restraining orders** saying he'd hit them. As payback for the jail time, he refused to pay **child support** for his two children. He had no interest in seeing either of his two boys because they were little liars like their mothers.\n\nMr. Crocker said he must have been smart because he had been able to make **Cs in school** despite showing up only half the time. He spent time in **juvenile hall** at age 14 for **stealing kid stuff**, like tennis shoes and wallets that were practically empty. He left school at age 15 after being framed for stealing a car by his **principal**. Mr. Crocker pointed out these historical facts as evidence that he was able to overcome **injustice and adversity**. A review of a **juvenile probation officer's report** indicated that beginning in the first grade, he often **bullied children with disabilities**, was noted to smile when his victims would cry, and consistently lacked remorse or guilt for his actions.\n\nIn regard to **substance use**, Mr. Crocker said he smoked **marijuana** as a teenager and started drinking **alcohol** on a regular basis after he first got married at age 22. He denied that use of either substance was a problem.\n\nMr. Crocker concluded the interview by demanding a note from the examiner that he had **bipolar** and **ADHD**. He said that he was bipolar because he had **ups and downs** and got mad real fast. Mr. Crocker denied other symptoms of mania. He said he got down when disappointed, but he had a short memory and could get out of a funk pretty quick. Mr. Crocker reported no difficulties in his **sleep**, **mood**, or **appetite**. He learned about **ADHD** because both of my boys got it. He concluded the interview with a request for medications, adding that the only ones that worked were **stimulants (any of them)** and a specific short-acting **benzodiazepine**.\n\nOn **mental status examination**, Mr. Crocker was a casually dressed man who made reasonable eye contact and was without abnormal movements. His speech was coherent, goal-directed, and of normal rate. There was no evidence of any **thought disorder** or **hallucinations**. He was **preoccupied with blaming others**, but these comments appeared to represent **overvalued ideas** rather than **delusions**. He was **cognitively intact**. His **insight into his situation** was poor.\n\nThe head of **human resources** did a **background check** during the course of the psychiatric evaluation. Phone calls revealed that Mr. Crocker had been **expelled from two carpentry training programs** and that both of his **graduation certificates** had been **falsified**. He had been fired from his job at one local construction company after a **fistfight** with his supervisor and from another job after abruptly leaving a job site. A quick review of the company's records indicated that Mr. Crocker had provided them with the same **false documentation**.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Crocker exhibits traits consistent with Antisocial Personality Disorder.  His disregard for rules and social norms, deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability, and lack of remorse are all indicative of this disorder.  He lacks insight into his problematic behavior and blames others for his difficulties."

        "clinical_case": "**Frank Yeomans, M.D., Ph.D. Otto Kernberg, M.D.**\n\n**Juanita Delgado**, a single, unemployed Hispanic woman, sought therapy at age 33 for treatment of depressed mood, chronic suicidal thoughts, social isolation, and poor personal hygiene. She had spent the prior 6 months isolated in her apartment, lying in bed, eating junk food, watching television, and doing more online shopping than she could afford. Multiple treatments had yielded little effect.\n\nMs. Delgado was the middle of three children in an upper-middle-class immigrant family in which the father reportedly valued professional achievement over all else. She felt isolated throughout her school years and experienced recurrent periods of depressed mood. Within her family, she was known for angry outbursts. She had done well academically in high school but dropped out of college because of frustrations with a roommate and a professor.\n\nShe had attempted a series of internships and entry-level jobs with the expectation that she would return to college, but she kept quitting because \"bosses are idiots. They come across as great and they all turn out to be twisted.\" These traumas always left her feeling terrible about herself (\"I can't even succeed as a clerk?\") and angry at her bosses (\"I could run the place and probably will\"). She had dated men when she was younger but never let them get close physically because she became too anxious when any intimacy began to develop. Most of her friends from the neighborhood had become \"frauds or losers,\" while she had stayed Facebook friends with some friends from college, and they were all \"doing amazing things all over the world. I'll definitely meet up with them if they ever come back to town.\"\n\nMs. Delgado said that she was generally down and depressed but that she had had dozens of 1- to 2-day manias in which she was energized and edgy and pulled all-nighters. She tended to crash the next day and sleep for 12 hours.\n\nMs. Delgado reported that she occasionally cut herself, but only superficially. She had persistent thoughts that she would be better off dead, and she had been psychiatrically hospitalized three times after overdoses.\n\nShe indicated that psychotherapy had never been especially helpful, nor had her medication treatments, which had included mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and low-dose antipsychotic medication.\n\nMrs. Delgado was a casually groomed and somewhat unkempt woman who was cooperative, coherent, and goal directed during the interview. She was generally dysphoric, with a constricted affect, but did smile appropriately several times. She described shame at her poor performance but also believed she was on Earth to do something great. She described her father as a \"spectacular success,\" but he was also a \"Machiavellian loser\" who was always trying to manipulate people. She described quitting jobs because people were disrespectful. Toward the end of the initial session, she became angry with the interviewer after he glanced at the clock (\"Are you bored already?\").",
        "diagnosis": "Based on Ms. Delgado's symptoms of depression, suicidal thoughts, mania, and history of psychiatric hospitalizations, a diagnosis of Bipolar type II disorder would be most appropriate.  Her current lack of significant mood symptoms suggests the possibility of it being in full remission. Further evaluation is needed to confirm the exact status of her condition."

Auchincloss, M.D.**\n\n**Karmen Fuentes** was a 50-year-old married Hispanic woman who presented to the psychiatric emergency room (ER) at the urging of her outpatient psychiatrist after telling him that she had been thinking about overdosing on Advil.\n\nIn the ER, Ms. Fuentes explained that her back had been killing her since she fell several days earlier at the family-owned grocery store where she had worked for many years. The fall had left her downcast and depressed, although she denied other depressive symptoms aside from a poor mood. She spoke at length about the fall and about how it reminded her of a fall that she had sustained a few years earlier. At that time, she had gone to see a neurosurgeon, who told her to rest and take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She described feeling abandoned and not cared about by him. The pain had diminished her ability to exercise, and she was upset that she had gained weight. While relating the events surrounding the fall, Ms. Fuentes began to cry.\n\nWhen asked about her suicidal comments, she said they were no big deal-they were just a threat aimed at her husband to teach him a lesson because he has no compassion for me and had not been supportive since the fall. She insisted that her comments about overdosing did not have another meaning. When her ER interviewer expressed concern about the possibility that she would kill herself, she exclaimed with a smile, Oh wow, I didn't realize it's so serious. I guess I shouldn't do that again. She then shrugged and laughed. She went on to talk about how nice and sweet it was that so many doctors and social workers wanted to hear her story, calling many of them by their first names. She was also somewhat flirtatious with her male resident interviewer, who had mentioned that she was the best-dressed woman in the ER.\n\nAccording to her outpatient psychiatrist of 3 years, she had never before expressed suicidal ideation until this week, and he would be unable to check in on her until after he left on vacation the next day. Ms. Fuentes's husband reported that she talked about suicide like other people complain about the weather. She's just trying to get me worried, but it doesn't work anymore. He said he would never have suggested she go to the ER and thought the psychiatrist had overreacted.\n\nMs. Fuentes initially sought outpatient psychotherapy at age 47 because she was feeling depressed and unsupported by her husband. During 3 years of outpatient treatment, Ms. Fuentes had been prescribed adequate trials of sertraline, escitalopram, fluoxetine, and paroxetine. None seemed to help.\n\nMs. Fuentes described being an early bloomer. She became sexually active with older men when she was in high school. She said dating had been the most fun thing she had ever done and that she missed seeing men jump through hoops to sleep with her. She lived with her 73-year-old husband. Her 25-year-old son lived nearby with his wife and young son. She described her husband as a very famous musician. She said that he had never helped around the house or with child-rearing and did not appreciate how much work she put into taking care of their son and grandson.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Ms. Fuentes's presentation suggests a possible diagnosis of  **Mental disorder affecting disorders or diseases classified elsewhere (6E40.0)**. Her psychological distress, particularly her suicidal ideation and manipulative behavior, could be negatively impacting her physical health conditions stemming from the back pain."

Mr. Goranov indicated to the clinic's psychiatric director that he had been depressed for many years, but weekly psychotherapy and multiple different psychiatric medications had made no difference.\n\n**Mr. Goranov** reported feeling sad, tired, and frustrated for decades. He rarely looked forward to anything. He had lost his last job 3 years earlier, had broken up with a girlfriend slightly later, and doubted that he would ever work or date again. He was embarrassed that he still lived with his mother, who was in her 80s. He denied any immediate intention or plan to kill himself, but stated that if he did not improve by the time his mother died, he did not see what he would have to live for. He denied disturbances in sleep, appetite, or concentration.\n\nClinic records indicated that Mr. Goranov had been adherent to adequate trials of fluoxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and bupropion, as well as augmentation with quetiapine, aripiprazole, lithium, and levothyroxine. He had experienced some improvement in his mood while taking escitalopram but did not have remission of symptoms. He also received a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy early in his treatment, but he had been dismissive of the therapist and treatment, did not do his assigned homework, and appeared to make no effort to use the therapy between sessions.\n\n**Mr. Goranov** expressed frustration at his lack of improvement, the nature of his treatment, and his specific therapy. He found it humiliating that he was forced to see trainees who rotated off his case every year or two. He frequently found that the psychiatry residents were not especially educated, cultured, or sophisticated, and thought that they knew less about psychotherapy than he did. He much preferred to work with female therapists because at least they're pretty, and men are too competitive and envious.\n\n**Mr. Goranov** had worked as an insurance broker from age 25 to 40. He explained, It's ridiculous. I was the best broker they had ever seen, but I still can't get a job. I think the problem is that the profession is filled with big egos, and I can't keep my mouth shut about it. After being blackballed by insurance agencies, Mr. Goranov did not work for 5 years, until he was hired by an automobile dealer. He said that although it was beneath him to sell cars, he was successful, and in no time, I was running the place. He quit within a few months after an argument with the owner. Despite encouragement from several therapists, Mr. Goranov had not applied for a job or pursued employment rehabilitation or volunteer work; he strongly viewed these options as beneath him.\n\n**Mr. Goranov** has given up on women. He had many partners as a younger man, but he generally found them to be unappreciative and only in it for the free meals. Psychotherapy notes from the clinic indicate that he responded to demonstrations of interest with suspicion. This tendency held true in regard to both women who had tried to befriend him and therapists who had taken an interest in his care. Mr. Goranov described himself as someone who had a lot of love to give, but added that the world was full of manipulators. He said he had a few buddies, but his mother was the only one he truly cared about. His parents had emigrated from Eastern Europe when he was a child. He had no siblings, and his father had died when the patient was 41. He had met a few relatives over the years, but they didn't speak English, so I didn't pay them much attention. He enjoyed fine restaurants and five-star hotels, but he added that he could no longer afford them. He exercised daily and was concerned about maintaining his body. Most of his time was spent at home watching television or reading novels and biographies.\n\nOn examination, the patient was neatly groomed, had slicked-back hair, and wore designer hip-hop-inspired clothing generally favored by men in their 20s. He was coherent, goal directed, and generally cooperative. He said he was sad and angry. His affect was constricted and dismissive. He denied an intention to kill himself but felt hopeless and thought of death fairly often. He was cognitively intact.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Larry Goranov's symptoms align more with Major Depressive Disorder (F32) from the ICD-11.  His persistent sadness, loss of interest, and feelings of hopelessness for an extended period meet the criteria. Additionally, his struggles with work, relationships, and social interaction further support this diagnosis."

She had recently moved to a new city to take classes to become an industrial lab technician and had moved in with an older cousin, who was also a psychotherapist and thought she should get out and enjoy her youth.\n\nAlthough she had previously been prescribed medications for anxiety, Ms. Herbert said that her real problem was **shyness**. School was difficult because everyone was constantly criticizing. She avoided being called on in class because she knew she would say something stupid and blush and everyone would make fun of her. She avoided speaking up or talking on telephones, worried about how she would sound. She dreaded public speaking.\n\nShe was similarly reticent with friends. She said she had always been a people pleaser who preferred to hide her feelings with a cheerful, compliant, attentive demeanor. She had a few friends, whom she described as warm and lifelong. She felt lonely after her recent move and had not yet met anyone from school or the local community.\n\nShe said she had broken up with her first serious boyfriend 2 years earlier. He had initially been kind and patient. Through him, she had a social life by proxy. Soon after she moved in with him, however, he turned out to be an angry alcoholic. She had not dated since that experience.\n\nMs. Herbert grew up in a metropolitan area with her parents and three older siblings. Her brother was hyperactive and antisocial and took up everyone's attention, whereas her sisters were hypercompetitive and perfect. Her mother was anxiously compliant, like me. Ms. Herbert's father was a very successful investment manager who often pointed out ways in which his children did not live up to his expectations. He could be supportive but tended to disregard emotional uncertainty in favor of a tough optimism. Teasing and competition saturated the household, and it didn't help that I was forced to go to the same girls' school where my sisters had been stars and where everyone was rich and catty. She developed a keen sensitivity to criticism and failure.\n\nHer parents divorced during her senior year of high school. Her father married another woman soon thereafter. Although she had planned to attend the same elite university as her two sisters, she chose to attend a local community college at the last minute. She explained that it was good to be away from all the competition, and her mother needed the support.\n\nMs. Herbert's strengths included **excellent work in her major, chemistry**, especially after one senior professor took a special interest. Family camping trips had led to a mastery of outdoor skills, and she found that she enjoyed being out in the woods, flexing her independence. She also enjoyed babysitting and volunteering in animal shelters, because kids and animals appreciate everything you do and aren't mean.\n\nDuring the evaluation, Ms. Herbert was a well-dressed young woman of short stature who was attentive, coherent, and goal directed. She smiled a lot, especially when talking about things that would have made most people angry. When the psychiatrist offered a trial comment, linking Ms. Herbert's current anxiety to experiences with her father, the patient said nothing but was visibly upset. After several such instances, the psychiatrist worried that any interpretive comments might be taken as criticism and had to check a tendency to avoid sensitive subjects. Explicitly discussing his concerns led both the patient and psychiatrist to relax and allowed the conversation to continue more productively.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Ms. Herbert's symptoms point towards  **Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.1)**. Her fear of social situations, avoidance of speaking up, and worry about being judged align with this diagnosis.  Her history of anxiety medication use and her description of feeling like she needs to 'break out of her shell' further support this conclusion."

Appelbaum, M.D.**\n\n**Nate Irvin** was a 31-year-old single white man who sought outpatient psychiatric services for lack of self-confidence. He reported lifelong troubles with assertiveness and was specifically upset by having been stuck for 2 years at his current dead-end job as an administrative assistant. He wished someone would tell him where to go next so that he would not have to face the burden of decision. At work, he found it easy to follow his boss's directions but had difficulty making even minor independent decisions. The situation was depressing, he said, but nothing new.\n\n**Mr. Irvin** also reported dissatisfaction with his relationships with women. He described a series of several-month-long relationships over the prior 10 years that ended despite his \"doing everything I could and never getting angry or yelling.\" His most recent relationship had been with an opera singer. He reported having gone to several operas and taken singing classes to impress her, even though he did not particularly enjoy music. That relationship had recently ended for unclear reasons. He said his mood and self-confidence were tied to his dating. Being single made him feel desperate, but desperation made it even harder to get a girlfriend. He said he felt trapped by that spiral.\n\nSince the latest breakup, he had been quite sad, with frequent crying spells. It was this depression that had prompted him to seek treatment. He denied all other symptoms of depression, including problems with sleep, appetite, energy, suicidality, and ability to enjoy things.\n\n**Mr. Irvin** initially denied taking any medications, but he eventually revealed that 1 year earlier his primary care physician had begun to prescribe alprazolam 0.5 mg/day for anxiety. His dose had escalated, and at the time of the evaluation, Mr. Irvin was taking 5 mg/day and getting prescriptions from three different physicians. Cutting back led to anxiety and the shakes.\n\n**Mr. Irvin** denied any prior personal or family psychiatric history, including outpatient psychiatric appointments.\n\nAfter hearing this history, the psychiatrist was concerned about Mr. Irvin's escalating alprazolam use and his chronic difficulties with independence. She thought the most accurate diagnosis was benzodiazepine use disorder comorbid with a personality disorder. However, she was concerned about the negative unintended effects that these diagnoses might have on the patient, including his employment and insurance coverage, as well as how he would be dealt with by future clinicians. She typed into the electronic medical record a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood. Two weeks later, Mr. Irvin's insurance company asked her for his diagnosis, and she gave the same diagnosis.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the information provided, Mr. Irvin's symptoms suggest  a personality disorder and benzodiazepine use disorder. However, the context focuses on diagnosis choices made by a psychiatrist due to potential negative consequences for the patient, rather than providing a definitive ICD-11 diagnosis.

Mr. Kleinman described a several-month-long apartment search that was made agonizing by Mr. Judd's work schedule and his endless list of apartment demands. They were unable to come to a decision, and eventually they decided to just share Mr. Judd's apartment. As Mr. Kleinman concluded, **Ogden won**.\n\n**Mr. Judd refused to hire movers for his boyfriend's belongings**, insisting on personally packing and taking an inventory of every item in his boyfriend's place. What should have taken 2 days took 1 week. Once the items were transported to Mr. Judd's apartment, Mr. Kleinman began to complain about Mr. Judd's **crazy rules** about where items could be placed on the bookshelf, which direction the hangers in the closet faced, and whether their clothes could be intermingled. Moreover, Mr. Kleinman complained that there was hardly any space for his possessions because Mr. Judd never threw anything away. **I'm terrified of losing something important**, added Mr. Judd.\n\nOver the ensuing weeks, arguments broke out nightly as they unpacked boxes and settled in. Making matters worse, Mr. Judd would often come home after 9:00 or 10:00 p.m., because he had a personal rule to always have a blank to-do list by the end of the day.\n\nMr. Kleinman would often wake early in the morning to find Mr. Judd grimly organizing shelves or closets or cleaning the floor. Throughout this process, Mr. Judd appeared to be working hard at everything while enjoying himself less and getting less done. Mr.Kleinman found himself feeling increasingly detached from his boyfriend the longer they lived together.\n\nMr. Judd denied symptoms of depression and free-floating anxiety. He said that he had never experimented with cigarettes or alcohol, adding, **I wouldn't want to feel like I was out of control**. He denied a family history of mental illness. He was raised in a two-parent household and was an above-average high school and college student. He was an only child and first shared a room as a college freshman. He described that experience as **being difficult due to conflicting styles-he was a mess and I knew that things should be kept neat**. He had moved mid-year into a single dorm room and had not lived with anyone until Mr. Kleinman moved in. Mr. Judd was well liked by his boss, earning recognition as employee of the month three times in 2 years. Feedback from colleagues and subordinates was less enthusiastic, indicating that he was a **micromanager** on shared projects, and often critical of his colleagues' efforts. Also, it seemed he had a reputation as a bore, stemming from a happy hour trivia night in which he had repeatedly questioned the answers his coworkers provided.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Judd was a thin man with eyeglasses and gelled hair, sitting on a couch next to his boyfriend. He was meticulously dressed. He was cooperative with the interview and sat quietly while his boyfriend spoke, interrupting on a few occasions to contradict. His speech was normal in rate and tone. His affect was irritable. There was no evidence of depression. He denied specific phobias and did not think he had ever experienced a panic attack. At the end of the consultation, Mr. Judd remarked, **I know I'm difficult, but I really do want this to work out**.",

Paul Fedoroff, M.D.**\n\n**Raven Lundquist** (she/her, preferring Raven) was a 24-year-old graduate student in philosophy who presented for a psychiatric evaluation at her brother's insistence. The two siblings lived together, and the brother threatened to withhold her allowance from a small trust if she didn't get some help.\n\n**Raven explained** that her brother was worried about her being sadomasochistic. In public, he might just say that he was worried that she was an alcoholic and out of control, but she thought he just didn't like her interest in BDSM (bondage, domination/discipline, sadism/submission, and masochism).\n\n**She said** that she had been in a relationship with Lilly for about a year. The two of them self-identified as queer, a label they found less stigmatizing than lesbian. One evening, after an evening of drinking with her brother, Raven told him that she and Lilly enjoyed going to bondage parties, where they would role-play mistress-slave scenes in which they would wear tight leather clothing and high heels, and Lilly would whip Raven and call her derogatory or humiliating names. Raven was fine with being seen as a masochist in public, but in private, she generally enjoyed being in charge.\n\n**Raven asked** the psychiatrist whether he was the kind of shrink who pathologizes everything? Surely, you're not like my brother, who gets squeamish about anything related to kink. But that's his problem, right doctor? Don't you agree that his concerns are just homophobia? She asked whether the psychiatrist had read *Justine* by the Marquis de Sade, which isn't as well written as *Lolita*, but it strikes a chord. By the way, Lilly laughs at my reading choices, calling me an 'old-school perv.'\n\n**On questioning about other BDSM activities,** Raven said she sometimes drugged Lilly without Lilly's knowledge. She found the sense of control to be extremely sexually exciting. Raven said she did not think Lilly would mind if she found out, given that Lilly identified as a sadomasochist and would often let Raven tie her up. Raven admitted that she had secretly drugged previous sexual partners, but that only one had complained about it, and only when she found photos on my camera. That lover had broken off the relationship immediately and claimed that she would have gone to the police if the photos weren't so embarrassing.\n\n**When asked about her brother's concern about her alcohol use,** Raven immediately said she did no illegal drugs, no tobacco, not even weed. Upon further questioning, she did say she might have an alcohol problem. She said she often planned to have a single drink but generally ended up getting significantly intoxicated. She generally got along well with Lilly and her brother, but they often got into verbal fights after everyone had become really drunk. She said she often enjoyed her binges, with the only problem being that she often missed early morning classes because of hangovers. She had no criminal history.\n\n**Raven's childhood history** was notable for having been abandoned by their mother while young. She and her brother had lived with relatives and in foster homes before they had been adopted by a woman whom she referred to as our intrusive but well-meaning pseudo-mother. That woman had died the year before, leaving behind a small trust fund for the two of them. Raven had memory gaps from her childhood and thought she might have been sexually molested. The abuse narrative would make sense, wouldn't it? But I really don't remember. Raven's medical history was pertinent for having had scoliosis; as a child, she was treated with insertion of a Harrington rod and an extended hospitalization.\n\n**Raven described** sexual attraction to both men and women but preferred women because they are typically more submissive. When she masturbated, and when she drugged sexual partners, she fantasized about power and control, particularly about molesting unwilling partners.\n\n**She said** she felt calm when in sexual control, and when intoxicated, but that she otherwise felt pretty anxious. Previous psychiatrists had diagnosed her with generalized anxiety disorder, for which she had been prescribed a benzodiazepine; these were also the medications she used to drug sexual partners.\n\n**Raven said** she sometimes felt down and depressed but did not think she had ever had a clinical depression. While often anxious, she denied ever having phobias or panic. She denied ever feeling suicidal but had sometimes thought about killing the drugged sexual partners, which, as you surely know, I would never actually do. She denied obsessions, compulsions, delusions, and hallucinations. She was intelligent and cognitively intact.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on Raven's history of  drug use without consent, fantasies of control and violence towards sexual partners, and her potential alcohol use disorder, a possible diagnosis is personality disorder with paraphilic features. Further evaluation is needed to determine the specific type of personality disorder present. Let me know if you have any other questions!"

Although he said he was embarrassed to discuss his issues with a stranger, he described his sexual interest in women's undergarments in a quite matter-of-fact manner. This interest had surfaced several years earlier and had not been a problem until he was caught masturbating by his wife 6 weeks prior to the evaluation. Upon seeing him dressed in panties and a bra, she initially went nuts, thinking he was having an affair. After he clarified that he was not seeing anyone else, she shut him out and hardly spoke to him. When they argued, she called him a pervert and made it clear that she was considering divorce unless he got help.\n\nMr. Najarian's habit began in the setting of his wife's severe arthritis and likely depression, both of which significantly reduced her overall activity level and specifically her interest in sex. His fetish was the bright spot during his frequent and otherwise dreary business trips. He also masturbated at home but generally waited until his wife was out of the house. His specific pattern was to masturbate about twice weekly, using bras and panties that he had collected over several years. He said that intercourse with his wife had faded to every month or two but was mutually satisfying.\n\nThe patient had been married for over 30 years, and the couple had two grown children. Mr. Najarian had planned to retire comfortably later that year, but not if the two choices were either to be poor after we split the assets or to sit around the house all day and be called a pervert.\n\nHe became visibly anxious when discussing his marital difficulties. He described some recent difficulty falling asleep and worried constantly about his marriage but denied other psychiatric problems. He had made a show of throwing away a half dozen pieces of underwear, which had seemed to reassure his wife, but he had saved his favorites and could always buy more. He said he was of mixed mind. He did not want to end his marriage, but he saw nothing harmful in his new mode of masturbating. 'I'm not unfaithful or doing anything bad,' he said. 'It just excites me, and my wife certainly doesn't want to be having sex a few times a week.'\n\nMr. Najarian denied any difficulties related to sexual functioning, adding that he could maintain erections and achieve orgasm without women's undergarments. He recalled being aroused when he touched women's underwear as a teenager and had masturbated repeatedly to that experience. That fantasy had disappeared when he became sexually active with his wife. He denied any personal or family history of mental illness.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, Mr. Najarian's case suggests  **Body Dysmorphic Disorder with fair to good insight**. His preoccupation with women's undergarments and masturbation using them, despite his wife's disapproval and distress, aligns with the disorder's criteria. Additionally, his acknowledgment that his behavior might be problematic ('could always buy more') indicates a degree of insight into his condition."

        "clinical_case": "**Charles L. Scott, M.D.**\n\n**Ike Crocker** was a **32-year-old white divorced carpenter** referred for a mental health evaluation by the **human resources department** of a large construction business that had been his employer for **2 weeks**. At his initial job interview, Mr. Crocker presented as very motivated and provided two carpentry school certifications that indicated a high level of skill and training. Since his employment began, his supervisors had noted **frequent arguments, absenteeism, poor workmanship, and multiple errors** that might have been dangerous. When confronted, he was reportedly dismissive, indicating that the problem was cheap wood and bad management and added that if someone got hurt, it's because of their own stupidity.\n\nWhen the head of **human resources** met with him to discuss termination, Mr. Crocker quickly pointed out that he had both **attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)** and **bipolar disorder**. He said that if not granted an accommodation under the **Americans with Disabilities Act**, he would sue. He demanded a **psychiatric evaluation**.\n\nDuring the mental health evaluation, Mr. Crocker focused on **unfairness at the company** and on how he was a hell of a better carpenter than anyone there could ever be. He claimed that his two **marriages** had ended because of **jealousy**. He said that his wives were always thinking, *I was with other women*, which is why they both lied to judges and got **restraining orders** saying he'd hit them. As payback for the jail time, he refused to pay **child support** for his two children. He had no interest in seeing either of his two boys because they were little liars like their mothers.\n\nMr. Crocker said he must have been smart because he had been able to make **Cs in school** despite showing up only half the time. He spent time in **juvenile hall** at age 14 for **stealing kid stuff**, like tennis shoes and wallets that were practically empty. He left school at age 15 after being framed for stealing a car by his **principal**. Mr. Crocker pointed out these historical facts as evidence that he was able to overcome **injustice and adversity**. A review of a **juvenile probation officer's report** indicated that beginning in the first grade, he often **bullied children with disabilities**, was noted to smile when his victims would cry, and consistently lacked remorse or guilt for his actions.\n\nIn regard to **substance use**, Mr. Crocker said he smoked **marijuana** as a teenager and started drinking **alcohol** on a regular basis after he first got married at age 22. He denied that use of either substance was a problem.\n\nMr. Crocker concluded the interview by demanding a note from the examiner that he had **bipolar** and **ADHD**. He said that he was bipolar because he had **ups and downs** and got mad real fast. Mr. Crocker denied other symptoms of mania. He said he got down when disappointed, but he had a short memory and could get out of a funk pretty quick. Mr. Crocker reported no difficulties in his **sleep**, **mood**, or **appetite**. He learned about **ADHD** because both of my boys got it. He concluded the interview with a request for medications, adding that the only ones that worked were **stimulants (any of them)** and a specific short-acting **benzodiazepine**.\n\nOn **mental status examination**, Mr. Crocker was a casually dressed man who made reasonable eye contact and was without abnormal movements. His speech was coherent, goal-directed, and of normal rate. There was no evidence of any **thought disorder** or **hallucinations**. He was **preoccupied with blaming others**, but these comments appeared to represent **overvalued ideas** rather than **delusions**. He was **cognitively intact**. His **insight into his situation** was poor.\n\nThe head of **human resources** did a **background check** during the course of the psychiatric evaluation. Phone calls revealed that Mr. Crocker had been **expelled from two carpentry training programs** and that both of his **graduation certificates** had been **falsified**. He had been fired from his job at one local construction company after a **fistfight** with his supervisor and from another job after abruptly leaving a job site. A quick review of the company's records indicated that Mr. Crocker had provided them with the same **false documentation**.",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided context, Vance Orren's behavior suggests a diagnosis of  Delusional Disorder, specifically with possible psychotic features due to his auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions. His history of nonadherence to treatment further complicates his condition. It is important to note that I am an AI and cannot provide a definitive diagnosis. Only a qualified medical professional can make a proper diagnosis after a thorough evaluation."

        "clinical_case": "**John W. Barnhill, M.D.**\n\n**Wallace Pickering** was a 29-year-old man who presented for outpatient therapy with a chief complaint of I've never been to a shrink before, but I just read DSM-5, and I have ten diagnoses, including six paraphilias, two personality disorders, a substance use disorder, and maybe something else. The patient described himself as an attorney who is a run-of-the-mill cisgender gay guy with a few kinks. He had been dating a former college classmate for the prior 2 years. A native of a mid-size city in the Midwest, Mr. Pickering was raised in a politically and religiously conservative household that included his parents and two younger siblings. Mr. Pickering's father and grandfather ran a prosperous business, and his family was very involved in their community. Mr. Pickering attended an elite college and law school. Since graduation, he had worked at a large law firm. He added that he was interested in his diagnoses at least partly because of his boyfriend, who was in his final year of training to be a psychiatrist.\n\n**Mr. Pickering described his problems as being about sex and drugs;** I've never cared much for rock and roll. Ever since high school, he described an interest in random sexual encounters. Not to be narcissistic-though that's one of my diagnoses-but I am kinda hot, he said, and I play it for what it's worth. This led him to frequent bathhouses and bars, where he could quickly connect to attractive, anonymous partners. He described feeling aroused when watching other people having sex and added that although he had quit the habit when he entered law school, he had previously gotten a thrill out of being watched while having sex. He said he had hooked up about once a month since age 20. He said he had never once had unsafe sex with anyone aside from his boyfriend, and this led him to mention another of his diagnoses: a fetishistic interest in rubber. He said condoms were great: they were virus proof, delayed ejaculation, and had an excellent smell. His interest in condoms had led him to get an outfit made entirely of rubber. He said it had been quite the hit at a bondage club, but it had made him so sweaty that he had worn it only once and had then thrown it away before his boyfriend found it. He mentioned that COVID had been isolating and terrible, but at least he got a chance to wear latex gloves out in public for a while, which was exciting in its way.\n\n**He said he also enjoyed tying up his boyfriend during sex and feeling completely in control.** He said he liked being a sadistic top every month or two but added that he also sometimes liked being a bottom and at other times did not feel sexual at all.\n\n**Mr. Pickering said that during his occasional pursuits of anonymous sex, he had a couple of toxic habits.** Whenever he went out partying, he would do a few lines of cocaine and drink about 4-6 beers. He said he always timed these trips to the underworld for times when his boyfriend went out of town, and he would have time to recover. He added that withdrawing from cocaine really sucks for a day or two, adding that he probably has a mood disorder related to the cocaine withdrawal.\n\n**He added that the planning had become more complicated and that he actually had probably only gone to a club twice in the prior year.** Overall, his social life is pretty boring. We have a lot of friends, but we're kinda like an old married couple. My only real vice is smoking. I have tried for years, but I haven't been able to get down below half a pack a day. Yawn.\n\n**When asked to say more about himself, Mr. Pickering answered,** Right . . . I almost forgot. I am obsessed by the hours that I work. I keep careful track so that I am among the top billers in the firm every month, and I always get my projects done on time, even if it means I don't sleep. My own theory is that it's part of my need to feel invulnerable and perfect despite being a mess on the inside. Mr. Pickering paused, smiled, and continued. That made me wonder if I'm obsessive-compulsive or narcissistic as well as having all the different paraphilias. Oh, and if hypersexuality is a diagnosis, then I'm really screwed.\n\n**Toward the end of the initial interview, the psychiatrist said,** I'm not sure if any of these behaviors are going to make it as a diagnosis, but I am very interested in how you feel. At that, Mr. Pickering welled up in tears and said he had felt sad and lonely all his life.\n\n**He added that his family knew almost nothing about him,** and that only a lesbian cousin-who had also moved to New York-knew that he was gay.\n\n**On examination, Mr. Pickering was a well-groomed, attractive young man who was coherent and goal directed.** He smiled readily but showed an appropriate affective range. He denied suicidality, confusion, and psychosis. He was cognitively very bright. His insight and judgment were viewed as intact.\n",
        "diagnosis": "Based on the provided information, it appears Mr. Pickering exhibits traits consistent with several personality disorders and paraphilias.  However, a definitive diagnosis can only be made by a qualified mental health professional after a comprehensive evaluation.  Further assessment is necessary to determine the specific diagnoses and their severity."
